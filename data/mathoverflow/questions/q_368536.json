  "body": "I tried to find an integral of the following, $\\DeclareMathOperator{\\erfc}{erfc}$ $\\int\\limits_0^{2\\pi} \\erfc(a + b\\cos(\\theta))\\erfc(c + d\\sin(\\theta))\\,d\\theta $ Where, $a,b,c,d \\in \\Bbb R$ Now, $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{j\\theta} + e^{-j\\theta}}{2};\\quad\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{j\\theta } - e^{-j\\theta }}{2j}$ Let $z = {e^{j\\theta }}$ Therefore, I can rewrite the integral as, $\\oint\\limits_{|z| = 1} {\\erfc\\left( {a + b\\left( {\\frac{{z + {z^*}}}{2}} \\right)} \\right)erfc\\left( {c + d\\left( {\\frac{{z - {z^*}}}{{2j}}} \\right)} \\right)\\frac{{dz}}{{iz}}} $ Again, let $f(z) = \\erfc\\left(a + b\\left(\\frac{z + z^*}{2}\\right)\\right)\\erfc\\left(c + d\\left(\\frac{z - z^*}{2j}\\right) \\right)$ Hence , the final integral can be written as, $\\oint\\limits_{|z| = 1}f(z)\\frac{dz}{iz} = 2\\pi f(0) = 2\\pi\\erfc(a)\\erfc(c)$ As $0$ falls inside $|z| = 1$ . Can you tell me if I am correct or wrong or it needs more reasoning?
