  "body": "Let $\\Omega\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^N$ be an open, bounded connected set having Lipschitz uniform boundary . Moreover let $d\\in L^{\\infty}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R}^M),\\ d_1(x),d_2(x),\\dots, d_M(x)>d>0,\\ \\forall\\ x\\in\\Omega$ and the linear operator: $$ A:D(A)\\subseteq X\\to X,\\ A(y)=d\\Delta y,\\ \\forall\\ y\\in D(A), $$ where $X\\subseteq \\{f:\\Omega\\to\\mathbb{R}^M\\ |\\ f\\text{ is a function}\\}$ is a Banach (or reflexive Banach, or Hilbert space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ ). We can have $$ X= \\begin{cases} L^2(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^M), & \\text{or}\\\\ H^1(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R}^M), & \\text{or}\\\\ L^p(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^M), & \\text{or}\\\\ L^{\\infty}(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^M), & \\text{or}\\\\ W^{k,p}(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^M) & \\text{or} \\\\\\text{etc}\\ldots\\\\ \\end{cases} $$ and $$ D(A)=\\left\\{y\\in X\\ \\Big| \\ d\\Delta y\\in X,\\ \\alpha_iy_i+\\beta_i\\dfrac{\\partial y_i}{\\partial\\nu}=0,\\ \\forall\\ i\\in\\overline{1,M}\\right\\}.$$ Here $\\alpha_i\\in C(\\partial\\Omega),\\beta_i\\in\\{0,1\\},\\ \\forall\\ i\\in\\overline{1,M}$ . My question is: what type of semigroup has $A$ as an infinitesimal generator ? Is it a strongly continuous semigroup (or $C_0$ semigroup), or analytic semigroup, or sectorial, or compact... Are there any references that deal with this problem with a Robin type boundary condition in a clear way, or at least with a Neumann boundary condition ? Somebody told me that if we have Neumann Boundary conditions ( $\\alpha_i=0,\\beta_i=1,\\ \\forall\\ i\\in \\overline{1,M}$ ) then the semigroup $(T(t))_{t\\geq 0}$ that generates $A$ is contractive and maps $L^1$ to $L^p$ with norm less than $Ct^{\\frac{-N}{p'}}$ , $1/p+1/p'=1$ . What does that mean exactly, and is there a reference for that topic?
