  "body": "I am looking for a sequence of functions $f_n,n\\geq 1$ in $L^2(\\mathbb R)$ such that $f_n$ is equal to $1$ on $[-n,n]$ and $\\hat{f_n}$ vanishes on $[-1,1]$ . Actually, I would also like $f_n$ to be $C_c^2$ but I can relax the spectral gap assumption to $\\int_{-1}^1 \\hat{f_n}^2$ can be arbitrarily small (i.e. smaller than $a_n$ for any sequence of positive numbers) EDIT: I am also interested in a result saying that this is impossible fourier-analysis fourier-transform spectral-gap Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 2, 2020 at 5:59 asked Jul 1, 2020 at 15:34 kaleidoscop 1,362 7 7 silver badges 18 18 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 3 $\\begingroup$ Are you imposing any conditions on how much $f_n$ may grow at infinity as $n\\to\\infty$? If you impose such conditions, then $f_n$ converges to 1 in ${\\cal S}'$. This would imply that $\\hat f_n$ converges to a delta function, which is not consistent with vanishing on $[-1,1]$. $\\endgroup$ Michael Renardy –  Michael Renardy 2020-07-01 16:46:31 +00:00 Commented Jul 1, 2020 at 16:46 $\\begingroup$ Maybe this is helpful: math.stackexchange.com/q/2332292/99220 mathoverflow.net/q/275072/107094 $\\endgroup$ Hyperplane –  Hyperplane 2020-07-01 21:30:47 +00:00 Commented Jul 1, 2020 at 21:30 $\\begingroup$ I am not imposing any condition, but as I indicated in my edit I am also interested in a negative result $\\endgroup$ kaleidoscop –  kaleidoscop 2020-07-02 05:59:35 +00:00 Commented Jul 2, 2020 at 5:59 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
