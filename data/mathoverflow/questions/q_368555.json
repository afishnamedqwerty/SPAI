  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - Primitive collections as lattice generators for the Mori cone",
  "body": "I am looking at the following theorem from \"Toric Varieties\" by Cox, Little and Schenk: Theorem 6.4.11: If $X_{\\Sigma}$ is a simplicial toric variety, then $\\overline{NE}(X_{\\Sigma}) = \\large{\\Sigma}_P \\mathbf{R}_{\\geq 0}r(P)$ , where the sum is over all primitive collections $P$ . Such primitive collections $P$ gives rise to a 1-cycle in $N_1(X_{\\Sigma})$ represented by an element $r(P) = (b_{\\rho})_{\\rho \\in \\Sigma(1)} \\in \\mathbf{R}^{\\Sigma(1)}$ , which can be shown to represent an effective class. Assuming that $X_{\\Sigma}$ is a smooth projective variety, it is easy to show that the numbers $b_{\\rho}$ are integral, in which case $r(P)$ sits inside $\\overline{NE}(X_{\\Sigma}) \\cap \\mathbf{Z}^n$ . Apparently, it is not known whether the $r(P)$ 's always generate $\\overline{NE}(X_{\\Sigma}) \\cap \\mathbf{Z}^n$ as a semigroup. However, I'm interested in the low-dimensional cases, specifically dimension 3. My question is: Is it known, or can it be shown that the $r(P)$ 's generate $\\overline{NE}(X_{\\Sigma}) \\cap \\mathbf{Z}^n$ for $X_{\\Sigma}$ smooth, projective and of dimension $3$ ? ag.algebraic-geometry algebraic-curves convex-geometry toric-varieties Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Aug 7, 2020 at 10:22 Mellon 197 1 1 silver badge 9 9 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
