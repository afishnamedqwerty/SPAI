  "body": "No nontrivial integer solutions to $$ a^5+b^5=c^5+d^5 \\qquad (1)$$ are known. (1) has infinitely many solutions in an extension of $\\mathbb{Z}$ (root of $9-15x+37x^2 $ ) resulting from a genus 0 curve and the identity $$ (-2 y - 1)^5 + (x + \\frac{1}{3} y - 1)^5- (\\frac{1}{3} y - 1)^5 - (x - 2 y - 1)^5 = $$ $$ \\left(-\\frac{35}{81}\\right) \\cdot y \\cdot (-3 x + 5 y + 6) \\cdot x \\cdot (9 x^{2} - 15 x y + 37 y^{2} - 18 x + 30 y + 18)$$ I wonder if some similar genus 0 or 1 curve might have points over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4 \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$, where $\\deg(p_i)=1$ and the $p_i^2$ are distinct. Let $P=p_1^5+p_2^5-p_3^5-p_4^5$. Q1. Can $P$ have an irreducible factor of degree 3? Q2. Is there a reason for all degree 2 factors of $P$ to not have infinitely many rational points over $\\mathbb{Q}$? I couldn't solve Q1 by equating coefficients (couldn't solve the system). Found a lot of genus 0 factors, but all of them didn't have rational points and linear factors gave only trivial solutions. nt.number-theory polynomials elliptic-curves diophantine-equations Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 14, 2018 at 9:36 Wolfgang 13.6k 5 5 gold badges 49 49 silver badges 108 108 bronze badges asked Apr 8, 2013 at 13:24 joro 25.8k 10 10 gold badges 69 69 silver badges 135 135 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 13 $\\begingroup$ That genus-zero parametrization gets rediscovered often. It's actually defined over ${\\bf Q}$ but alas has no rational points, being birational with the conic $x^2+y^2+z^2=0$. The nice way to see it is to intersect the quintic surface $a^5+b^5+c^5+d^5=0$ with the line $a+b+c+d=0$: the resulting quintic curve decomposes into three lines $a+b=c+d=0$, $a+c=d+b=0$, $a+d=b+c=0$, and a residual conic with $S_4$ symmetry that has no rational or even real roots but does work over ${\\bf Q}(i)$ and various other totally imaginary number fields. $\\endgroup$ Noam D.
