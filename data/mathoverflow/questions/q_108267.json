  "title": "tag removed - Azimuthal and polar integration of a 3D Gaussian",
  "body": "Numerical evaluation of the following integral of a 3D gaussian $G$ seems to result in a 1D Gaussian $g$ : $$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\pi}G(R,\\phi,\\theta)\\sin\\theta\\ \\text{d}\\theta \\ \\text{d}\\phi= g(R)$$ where the 3D Gaussian in spherical coordinates with mean $\\mu$ and covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ $$G(R,\\phi,\\theta)=H \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}(X-\\mu)^{T}\\cdot \\Sigma^{-1}\\cdot (X-\\mu)\\right]$$ $$X=\\begin{bmatrix}R\\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta\\\\\\ R\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta\\\\\\ R\\cos\\theta\\end{bmatrix}$$ and the 1D Gaussian with mean $R_\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ $$g(R)=H'\\exp\\left[-\\frac{(R-R_\\mu)}{2\\sigma^2}\\right]$$ The question is: is this true? I realize this is a forum for more fundamental mathematics, but I've asked this question on applied math and physics forums without any luck ( link ). I'd be grateful if someone can give me a hit on how to approach this. My attempt to solve this problem involved transforming $G$ so that $\\mu=(0\\ 0\\ R_\\mu)$ (adapting $\\Sigma$ in the process) and substitute $z=\\cos\\theta$ . However I couldn't solve the integral over $z$ and $\\phi$ . Edit The special case where $\\Sigma=\\sigma^2I$ proves that this is not a Gaussian but it is very close. For $R_\\mu\\gg\\sigma$ we find ( link ) $$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\pi}G(R,\\phi,\\theta)\\sin\\theta\\ \\text{d}\\theta \\ \\text{d}\\phi= \\frac{g(R)}{RR_\\mu}(1-\\exp(-\\frac{2RR_{\\mu}}{\\sigma^2}))\\approx\\frac{g(R)}{RR_\\mu}$$ If I could find a similar result for any $\\Sigma$ , it would solve my problem. tag-removed Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Sep 27, 2012 at 17:20 Wox 357 1 1 silver badge 9 9 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 $\\begingroup$ Please try math.stackexchange.com.
