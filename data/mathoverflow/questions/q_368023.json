  "title": "gr.group theory - Alternating $n$-homomorphism on abelian group is skew of $n$-cocycle",
  "body": "Let $A$ be a finitely generated abelian group. Let $c$ be a 2-cocycle on $A$ , where $A$ acts trivially on $\\mathbb{C}^\\times$ . It is well-known that the skew-map $$ c(a_1,a_2) \\longmapsto \\frac{c(a_1,a_2)}{c(a_2,a_1)}$$ induces a surjective homomorphism $H^2(A,\\mathbb{C}^\\times) \\to \\bigwedge^2(A,\\mathbb{C}^\\times)$ , where $\\bigwedge^2(A,\\mathbb{C}^\\times)$ is the group of alternating bihomomorphisms on $G$ . If I remember correctly, this is even an isomorphism, but I couldn't find the statement anymore. Now, let $d \\in Z^3(A,\\mathbb{C}^\\times)$ be a 3-cocycle on $A$ . We can now define a higher skew-map $$d(a_1,a_2,a_3) \\longmapsto \\prod_{\\sigma \\in S_3} d(a_{\\sigma(1)},a_{\\sigma(2)},a_{\\sigma(3)})^{\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)}.$$ Again, this induces a homomorphism $H^3(A,\\mathbb{C}^\\times) \\to \\bigwedge^3(A,\\mathbb{C}^\\times)$ , where $\\bigwedge^3(A,\\mathbb{C}^\\times)$ is now the group of alternating trihomomorphisms. By alternating trihomomorphisms I mean homomorphisms $t:A \\otimes A \\otimes A \\to \\mathbb{C}^\\times$ , s.t. $t(a,a,b)=1=t(a,b,b)$ for all $a,b \\in A$ . I didn't check, but I believe this is possible for higher $n$ -cocycles as well with the obvious definition of a higher skew map. I believe this is all known, but I couldn't find it anywhere. In particular, I would like to know if the induced homomorphisms are again surjective (or even bijective). gr.group-theory group-cohomology abelian-groups Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 31, 2020 at 14:37 LSpice 14k 4 4 gold badges 48 48 silver badges 76 76 bronze badges asked Jul 31, 2020 at 12:09 Bipolar Minds 1,912 10 10 silver badges 17 17 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 1 $\\begingroup$ Do you also want $t(a, b, a) = 1$ for all $t$? $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-07-31 14:37:22 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 14:37 1 $\\begingroup$ @LSpice I think it follows from the other two conditions and $t$ being a homomorphism $\\endgroup$ Bipolar Minds –  Bipolar Minds 2020-07-31 14:40:06 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 14:40 1 $\\begingroup$ @LSpice I got $t(a,b,a)=\\frac{t(a,a+b,a+b)}{t(a,a,a+b)t(a,b,b)}$ but probably its the same as yours $\\endgroup$ Bipolar Minds –  Bipolar Minds 2020-07-31 14:52:41 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 14:52 $\\begingroup$ No, yours is right and mine (which I have now deleted) is wrong; I was incorrectly treating it as a homomorphism $A \\times A \\times A \\to \\mathbb C^\\times$. $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-07-31 16:38:23 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 16:38 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
