  "body": "Let $\\text{sTop},\\text{ssTop}$ denote the categories of simplicial, semi-simplicial spaces respectively. There is a functor $E:\\text{ssTop}\\rightarrow \\text{sTop}$ that is left adjoint to the forgetful functor $E:\\text{sTop}\\rightarrow \\text{ssTop}$ . Given a semi-simplicial space $X_{\\bullet}$ , $EX_{\\bullet}$ is the simplicial space with $p$ -simplices $$EX_{p}:=\\coprod_{\\beta :[p]\\twoheadrightarrow [q]}(X_{q},\\beta ),$$ where $[n]$ denotes the linearly-ordered set $\\{0<1<\\cdots < n\\}$ . The simplicial data of $EX_{\\bullet}$ is as follows. Let $\\gamma :[r]\\rightarrow [p]$ be a map of finite linearly ordered sets. For a surjection $\\beta: [p]\\twoheadrightarrow [q]$ , factor $\\beta\\circ \\gamma : [r]\\rightarrow [q]$ as the composition $\\gamma_{1}\\circ \\beta_{1}: [r]\\rightarrow [q]$ , where $\\beta_{1}:[r]\\twoheadrightarrow [s]$ is a surjection and $\\gamma_{1}:[s]\\hookrightarrow [q]$ is an injection, and define $\\gamma : EX_{p}\\rightarrow EX_{r}$ on $(X_{q},\\beta )$ to be the map $\\gamma_{1}^{*}:(X_{q},\\beta )\\rightarrow (X_{s}, \\beta_{1})\\subset EX_{r}$ (more details are given on page 3 of Ebert and Randal-Williams' Semi-simplicial spaces , arXiv: 1705.03774 ). Is it known if (or under which conditions) the thick geometric realization $\\Vert EX_{\\bullet}\\Vert$ and the thin geometric realization $\\vert EX_{\\bullet}\\vert$ are weakly equivalent? If the $p$ -simplices $X_{p}$ are empty for $p>2$ , then the thick and thin geometric realizations are weakly equivalent by directly checking that the degeneracy maps $s_{i}:EX_{p}\\rightarrow EX_{p+1}$ are cofibrations for all $i$ and $p$ (in this case, $EX_{\\bullet}$ is what Segal calls a \" good \" simplicial space, so its thick and thin geometric realizations are weakly equivalent). at.algebraic-topology homotopy-theory simplicial-stuff Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 17, 2020 at 10:27 David Roberts ♦ 37k 13 13 gold badges 143 143 silver badges 388 388 bronze badges asked Jun 17, 2020 at 8:01 user159744 51 1 1 bronze badge $\\endgroup$ 1 4 $\\begingroup$ The degeneracy maps are always just the inclusion of some terms in the disjoint union, so are cofibrations. So $EX_\\bullet$ is always good. $\\endgroup$ Oscar Randal-Williams –  Oscar Randal-Williams 2020-06-17 18:33:03 +00:00 Commented Jun 17, 2020 at 18:33 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
