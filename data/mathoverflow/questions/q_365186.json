  "title": "dg.differential geometry - A generalization to Bott‘s theorem (from Milnor’s “Morse theory”)",
  "body": "This is Theorem 22.1 of Milnor‘s Morse theory: Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold, let $p,q\\in M$ be so that the space $\\Omega’$ of minimal geodesics joining $p$ to $q$ is a topological manifold, and every such geodesic has Morse index $\\geq c$ . Then $\\pi_i(\\Omega’)$ is isomorphic to $\\pi_i(\\Omega)$ for $i\\leq c-2$ , where $\\Omega$ is the space of curves joining $p$ to $q$ . For example, let $M$ be the round $n$ -sphere, $p,q$ be the north and south pole, then $\\Omega’$ is the $n-1$ sphere. Is there a generalisation to this theorem, in which we replace $\\{p,q\\}$ by some closed curve $\\gamma$ in $M$ , $\\Omega’$ by the space (which should assumed to be a manifold) of area-minimising disks in $M$ with boundary $\\gamma$ , and $\\Omega$ by the space of disk in $M$ with boundary $\\gamma$ ? dg.differential-geometry differential-topology morse-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 9, 2020 at 0:26 JSCB 1,640 10 10 silver badges 21 21 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
