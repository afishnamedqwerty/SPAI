  "body": "If $G(q),H(q)$ are the functions appearing in Rogers-Ramanujan identities $$G(q)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{q^{n^{2}}}{(q;q)_{n}}=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(1-q^{5n-1})(1-q^{5n-4})}$$ and $$H(q)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{q^{n^{2}+n}}{(q;q)_{n}}=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(1-q^{5n-2})(1-q^{5n-3})}$$ then it is known that $q^{-1/60}G(q)$ and $q^{11/60}H(q)$ are modular forms of same weight and hence each of them must be expressible in the form $$\\left(\\frac{2K}{\\pi}\\right)^{s}A(k)$$ where $s$ is the weight of the modular form and $A(k)$ is some algebraic function of $k$. Do we know the explicit expressions for $G(q),H(q)$ in terms of $K,k$? I would want to use these expressions (coupled with modular equations) to prove Ramanujan's identities like $$G(q^{11})H(q)-q^{2}G(q)H(q^{11})=1$$ modular-forms ramanujan Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Dec 20, 2018 at 16:54 Wolfgang 13.6k 5 5 gold badges 49 49 silver badges 108 108 bronze badges asked Sep 26, 2014 at 12:15 Paramanand Singh 2,337 1 1 gold badge 20 20 silver badges 35 35 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ I think such expressions are likely to be extremely unwieldy. $q^{1/5} G(q)/H(q)$ is a generator for the field of functions on $\\tilde{X}(5)$, which is a degree $60$ cover of $X(1)$ and $k$ (which I presume is $\\vartheta_{2}(q)^{2}/\\vartheta_{3}(q)^{2}$) is a generator for the field of modular functions on $X_{0}(4)$. Thus the algebraic relation between $k$ and $R = q^{1/5} G(q)/H(q)$ has degree $60$ in $R$ and degree $3$ in $k$. I would guess the individual expressions for $G(q)$ and $H(q)$ would be worse. $\\endgroup$ Jeremy Rouse –  Jeremy Rouse 2014-09-26 16:55:47 +00:00 Commented Sep 26, 2014 at 16:55 $\\begingroup$ @JeremyRouse: Thanks for the inputs. The relation between $R$ and $k$ is definitely complicated but at least we have relation like $$\\frac{1}{R} -1-R=\\frac{f(-q^{1/5})}{q^{1/5}f(-q^{5})}$$ where $f(-q)=(q;q)_{\\infty}$ is essentially the eta function. I don't think $G(q), H(q)$ would have any simple relation with eta function individually. I guess I will have to use the product form of $G(q),H(q)$ to prove the Ramanujan identities. $\\endgroup$ Paramanand Singh –  Paramanand Singh 2014-09-27 02:46:59 +00:00 Commented Sep 27, 2014 at 2:46 $\\begingroup$ @ParamanandSingh: You may like this related post . $\\endgroup$ Tito Piezas III –  Tito Piezas III 2015-07-07 04:51:38 +00:00 Commented Jul 7, 2015 at 4:51 $\\begingroup$ @TitoPiezasIII: I am reading your post.
