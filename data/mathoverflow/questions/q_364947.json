  "title": "gr.group theory - Semicharacters on groups",
  "body": "I think, this must be simple, but apparently, I don't have enough intuition, so excuse me. The following construction is useful in the holomorphic duality theory for complex Lie Groups : Let $G$ be an arbitrary group. A function $s:G\\to [1,+\\infty)$ is called a semicharacter on $G$ , if $$ s(x\\cdot y)\\le s(x)\\cdot s(y),\\qquad x,y\\in G. $$ Question: is it true that for any group $G$ , for any its subgroup $H\\subseteq G$ and for any semicharacter $c:H\\to [1,+\\infty)$ there is a semicharacter $s:G\\to [1,+\\infty)$ that majorates $c$ on $H$ : $$ c(x)\\le s(x),\\qquad x\\in H $$ ? gr.group-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 6, 2020 at 11:29 Sergei Akbarov 7,476 2 2 gold badges 31 31 silver badges 57 57 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 8 $\\begingroup$ I guess this is usually called \"submultiplicative\". $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-07-06 11:31:58 +00:00 Commented Jul 6, 2020 at 11:31 $\\begingroup$ Yes, this can be called \"a submultiplicative function\". $\\endgroup$ Sergei Akbarov –  Sergei Akbarov 2020-07-06 11:32:58 +00:00 Commented Jul 6, 2020 at 11:32 1 $\\begingroup$ No it's not true in general. On $\\mathbf{Z}$, consider the function $n\\mapsto 2^{|n|}$. If $\\mathbf{Z}$ is embedded in the center of the Heisenberg group (or in any group where it's distorted), every subadditive function on the Heisenberg is $\\le C\\sqrt{|n|}$ on $\\mathbf{Z}$, hence every submultiplciative function on $\\mathbf{Z}$ extending to a submultiplicative function is $\\le\\exp( C\\sqrt{|n|})$ for some $C>0$. The usual keyword is \"distortion\". $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-07-06 11:35:55 +00:00 Commented Jul 6, 2020 at 11:35 $\\begingroup$ YCor, and why is each subadditive function on the Heisenberg group $\\le C\\sqrt{|n|}$ on $\\mathbb{Z}$? $\\endgroup$ Sergei Akbarov –  Sergei Akbarov 2020-07-06 11:45:06 +00:00 Commented Jul 6, 2020 at 11:45 1 $\\begingroup$ Hint: $[e_{12}^n,e_{23}^n]=e_{13}^{n^2}$, where $e_{ij}=I_3+E_{ij}$. $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-07-06 11:50:46 +00:00 Commented Jul 6, 2020 at 11:50  |  Show 3 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
