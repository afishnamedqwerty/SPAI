  "body": "The base field is algebraically closed and of chatacteristic zero. If $X$ is a smooth projective curve and $Y\\to X$ is an étale covering of $X$ of degree $d$ , then what can we say about the automorphism group $\\mathrm{Aut}(Y/X)$ of $Y$ over $X$ ? Is it always nontrivial? ag.algebraic-geometry etale-covers Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 30, 2020 at 17:06 RobPratt 5,784 1 1 gold badge 16 16 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges asked Jul 30, 2020 at 4:11 user190964 347 2 2 silver badges 8 8 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 6 2 $\\begingroup$ By etale covering do you mean finite etale map? If so, this is just Galois theory. The map corresponds to a finite index index $d$ subgroup $H\\le\\pi_1(X)$, and the automorphism group is just the automorphism group of the corresponding $\\pi_1(X)$-set. IIRC this should just be the quotient of the normalizer of $H$ by $H$. Sometimes it'll be trivial. For example you can fix a surjection $f : \\pi_1(X)\\rightarrow S_3$ (symmetric group on 3 things), and let $H$ be the preimage of an order 2 subgroup of $S_3$. The resulting cover will have trivial aut group for the same reason that $Q(\\sqrt{3})$ does $\\endgroup$ Will Chen –  Will Chen 2020-07-30 04:17:47 +00:00 Commented Jul 30, 2020 at 4:17 $\\begingroup$ I mean finite étale maps. I am confused that there may exist a nontrivial finite separable extension $F$ of $K(X)$ with trivial automorphism group $\\mathrm{Aut}(F/K(X))$ and $F$ corresponds to a curve $Y$ by $Y=F(X)$. $\\endgroup$ user190964 –  user190964 2020-07-30 04:24:47 +00:00 Commented Jul 30, 2020 at 4:24 $\\begingroup$ What is $F(X)$? $\\endgroup$ Will Chen –  Will Chen 2020-07-30 04:30:30 +00:00 Commented Jul 30, 2020 at 4:30 $\\begingroup$ I just checked your additional comments and try to make the picture clear. $K$ means the base field, and my comments comes from the correspondences between 1. smooth algebraic curves and its function field $X\\leftrightarrow K(X)$, 2. finite etale morphism $Y\\to X$ and finite separable field extension $K(Y)/K(X)$, and 3. the automorphism groups $\\mathrm{Aut}(Y/X)\\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{Aut}(K(Y)/K(X))$. $\\endgroup$ user190964 –  user190964 2020-07-30 04:37:28 +00:00 Commented Jul 30, 2020 at 4:37 $\\begingroup$ Could explain what is the corresponding $\\pi_1(X)$-set?
