  "title": "co.combinatorics - A conjecture on circular permutations of n elements in an abelian group of odd order",
  "body": "In 2013 I formulated the following conjecture in additive combinatorics. Conjecture. Let $G$ be an additive abelian group of odd order, and let $A$ be a subset of $G$ with $|A|=n>2$ . Then, there is a circular permutation $(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)$ of all the elements of $A$ such that all the adjacent sums $ a_1+a_2,\\ldots,a_{n-1}+a_n,a_n+a_1$ are pairwise distinct. Recently, Mr. Yu-Xuan Ji, a student at Nanjing Univ., verified this conjecture for $|G|<30$ . I'm even unable to show the conjecture for $G=\\mathbb Z/p\\mathbb Z$ with $p$ an odd prime. Any ideas towards the solution of this conjecture?
