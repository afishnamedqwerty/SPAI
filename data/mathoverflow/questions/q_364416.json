  "title": "algebraic groups - Why does norm map the $\\sigma$-conjugacy classes to the conjugacy classes?",
  "body": "Let $E/F$ be a cyclic extension of order $\\ell$ (not assumed prime) of fields of characteristic $0$ , and $\\Sigma$ its Galois group; we denote by $\\sigma$ a generator of $\\Sigma$ . We denote by $G(E), G(F)$ the groups of $E,F$ -rational point on $G={\\rm GL}_{n}$ . Two elements $g,h\\in G(E)$ are called $\\sigma$ -conjugate if $g=x^{-1}hx^{\\sigma}$ for some $x\\in G(E)$ , and $N(g)=gg^{\\sigma}\\cdots g^{\\sigma^{\\ell-1}}$ is called the norm of $x$ . Question. Is the norm map an injection from the set of $\\sigma$ -conjugacy classes in $G(E)$ into the set of conjugacy classes in $G(F)$ ? This is the assertion of lemma 1.1 in ''Simple Algebra, Base Change, and the Advanced Theory of the Trace Formula\" written by J. Arthur and L. Clozel. Their proof was very hard to understand for me. algebraic-groups galois-theory reductive-groups local-fields trace-formula Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 29, 2020 at 14:43 Mikhail Borovoi 15.4k 2 2 gold badges 39 39 silver badges 88 88 bronze badges asked Jun 29, 2020 at 13:02 M masa 489 2 2 silver badges 8 8 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 $\\begingroup$ What is your question? (The title and body are different.) Are you looking for a yes/no answer? An explanation of their proof? My recollection is that it's just an argument in Galois cohomology. $\\endgroup$ Kimball –  Kimball 2020-06-29 18:19:05 +00:00 Commented Jun 29, 2020 at 18:19 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
