  "body": "Let $M\\in\\mathbb{C}^{n\\times n}$ be an arbitary Hermitian matrix and let $E$ be a subspace of $\\mathbb{C}^n$ . Is there a method to find vectors $y,z\\in E$ such that $$\\dfrac{y^*My}{y^*y}=\\sup_{x\\in E\\\\ x\\neq0}\\dfrac{x^*Mx}{x^*x}\\mbox{ and }\\dfrac{z^*Mz}{z^*z}=\\inf_{x\\in E\\\\ x\\neq0}\\dfrac{x^*Mx}{x^*x}\\hspace{3mm}?$$ If $E=\\mathbb{C}^n$ then $x$ and $y$ will be any eigenvector of $M$ corresponding to the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $M$ respectively, so the method to find them is standard. How to find $y$ and $z$ when $E$ is a proper subspace of $\\mathbb{C}^n$ with $\\dim(E)>1$ ? linear-algebra matrices eigenvalues Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 22, 2020 at 18:46 asked Jun 17, 2020 at 19:58 Chilote 636 6 6 silver badges 10 10 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ Is there any reason you can't choose a basis of $E$, write $M$ in that basis, and proceed according to standard methods? $\\endgroup$ Neal –  Neal 2020-06-17 20:40:05 +00:00 Commented Jun 17, 2020 at 20:40 $\\begingroup$ @Neal could you please be a little more specific?

Then extremize the Rayleigh quotient of $N$ over $E$. By construction this will yield the extremal values of the Rayleigh quotient of $M$ over $E$. $\\endgroup$ Neal –  Neal 2020-06-18 13:27:37 +00:00 Commented Jun 18, 2020 at 13:27 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
