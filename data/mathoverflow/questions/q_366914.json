  "body": "For a natural number $n$ , let $f(n) := \\sum_{d\\mid n}\\frac{\\phi(d)}{d}$ , where $\\phi$ is the Euler-phi function. I believe this is a multiplicative function. I'm looking for a nontrivial (sublinear) upper bound for it - ie, a reasonably simple and explicit monotonically increasing function $B(n)$ such that $f(n)\\le B(n)$ for all $n\\ge 1$ , and moreover $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{B(n)}{n} = 0$ This function came up in my research. I can see that the worst case scenario happens when $n$ has many distinct prime divisors, though I'm not an analytic number theorist it's not obvious how to get a nontrivial upper bound to me. In any case, this is a simple enough looking function that I assume there must be results on this somewhere (which are presumably better than anything I could come up with given some time). I'm particularly interested in an upper bound to the function $f$ when it's restricted to numbers of the form $p\\pm 1$ , where $p$ is a prime, in case this particular case has been studied. nt.number-theory analytic-number-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 30, 2020 at 5:01 stupid_question_bot 7,795 1 1 gold badge 13 13 silver badges 53 53 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 6 6 $\\begingroup$ Since $\\phi(d)\\le d$, clearly $f(n) \\le d(n)$ where $d(n)$ denotes the number of divisors of $n$. Pairing a divisor $d$ with $n/d$, and noting that at least one of $d$ or $n/d$ must be $\\le \\sqrt{n}$, one sees easily that $d(n) \\le 2\\sqrt{n}$. Of course much more be said (e.g. $d(n) \\le C(\\epsilon) n^{\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon >0$), but this may be enough for you. Look up bounds for divisor function in (just about) any elementary number theory book. $\\endgroup$ Lucia –  Lucia 2020-07-30 05:14:50 +00:00 Commented Jul 30, 2020 at 5:14 6 $\\begingroup$ This is a multiplicative function; on prime powers, it satisfies $f(p^r) = \\sum_{j = 0}^{r} \\phi(p^j) p^{-j} = \\sum_{j = 0}^{r} (1 - p^{-1}) = (1 - p^{-1}) (r + 1)$ since $\\phi(p^j) = p^j (1 - p^{-1})$. So $f(n) = \\frac{\\phi(n)}{n} \\tau(n)$, where $\\tau(n) = \\# \\{d \\mid n\\}$ denotes the divisor function. Of course $\\frac{\\phi(n)}{n} \\leq 1$, while upper bounds for the divisor function are well-known: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function . Note that these are \"worst case\" bounds, which are at primorials $n = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_m$, which cannot be of the form $p \\pm 1$. $\\endgroup$ Peter Humphries –  Peter Humphries 2020-07-30 05:15:00 +00:00 Commented Jul 30, 2020 at 5:15 1 $\\begingroup$ If $n=\\prod_{i=1}^{r} p_i^{a_i}$, then $f(n)=\\prod_{i=1}^{r}(\\sigma_i+1)$, where $\\sigma_i=(1-\\frac{1}{p_i})a_i$. $\\endgroup$ Alapan Das –  Alapan Das 2020-07-30 05:46:34 +00:00 Commented Jul 30, 2020 at 5:46 $\\begingroup$ @Lucia Ah, great! That's an excellent observation. If you'd like to put that as an answer I'd be happy to mark this question answered. Thanks! $\\endgroup$ stupid_question_bot –  stupid_question_bot 2020-07-30 06:07:24 +00:00 Commented Jul 30, 2020 at 6:07 $\\begingroup$ Also, $ln(n)+\\sum_{i=1}^{N} ln(p_i)= \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\sigma_i+1)ln(p_i)(\\frac{p_i}{p_i-1})$. Say, $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} ln(p_i)(\\frac{p_i}{p_i-1})=\\chi$ Hence, $f(n) \\leq \\left(1+\\frac{ln(n)}{\\chi}\\right)^{\\chi}$. Here, $N$ can be chosen as big as possible. $p_i := i$th prime number. $\\endgroup$ Alapan Das –  Alapan Das 2020-07-30 06:10:04 +00:00 Commented Jul 30, 2020 at 6:10  |  Show 1 more comment 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
