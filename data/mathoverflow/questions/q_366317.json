  "body": "Intuitionistic and classical propositional logic, and even classical first-order logic with identity, have algebraic counterparts. Algebraizable logics , 1989, by Willem J. Blok and Don Pigozzi, is a classical reference. Is more now known about whether stronger systems are algebraizable? lo.logic Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 22, 2020 at 21:12 YCor 67.5k 5 5 gold badges 203 203 silver badges 301 301 bronze badges asked Jul 22, 2020 at 21:05 Frode Alfson Bjørdal 4,132 1 1 gold badge 19 19 silver badges 37 37 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 1 $\\begingroup$ Sure, instead of saying $x^3+y^3=z^3\\to xyz=0$, say $\\max((xyz)^2(1-(x^3+y^3-z^3)^2))=0$. $\\endgroup$ user44143 –  user44143 2020-07-22 22:16:35 +00:00 Commented Jul 22, 2020 at 22:16 $\\begingroup$ At least that was discovered after 1989. :) $\\endgroup$ Frode Alfson Bjørdal –  Frode Alfson Bjørdal 2020-07-22 22:31:05 +00:00 Commented Jul 22, 2020 at 22:31 $\\begingroup$ For this case, Euler had everything needed by 1770. $\\endgroup$ user44143 –  user44143 2020-07-22 23:12:16 +00:00 Commented Jul 22, 2020 at 23:12 $\\begingroup$ Indeed.
