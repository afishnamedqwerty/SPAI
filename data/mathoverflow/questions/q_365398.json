  "body": "Let a percolation measure be a measure on $\\{0,1\\}^n$ . We have a natural partial order on $\\{0,1\\}^n$ given by comparing all coordinates. An event $A$ is called increasing if for all $ \\omega \\in A $ we have for every $\\eta \\geq \\omega$ that $\\eta \\in A$ . Now a percolation measure $\\mu$ satisfies the FKG inequality if for all increasing events $A, B$ we have that $$\\mu(A \\cap B) \\geq \\mu(A) \\mu(B).$$ A criterion for FKG is the FKG-lattice condition. To state it for $v \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ and $e, f \\in \\{1, \\dots , n \\}$ with $e \\neq f$ let the configurations $v_{ef}, v^{ef}, v_{e}^f,v^{e}_f$ be the configurations that coincide with $v$ for all but the two entries $e,f$ and there $v_{ef}(e) = 0 = v_{ef}(f) $ , $v_{e}^f(e) = 0, v_{e}^f(f) = 1$ etc. If we always have that $$ \\mu(v_{ef}) \\mu(v^{ef}) \\geq \\mu(v_{e}^f) \\mu(v^{e}_f) $$ and $\\mu(v) > 0 $ for all $v$ (i.e. strictly positive). Then this implies FKG (see Ex. 11.2 here https://www.ihes.fr/~duminil/publi/2017PIMS.pdf ). Now, what are (interesting) examples of percolation measures that do not satisfy the FKG lattice condition, but that do satisfy FKG? pr.probability mp.mathematical-physics inequalities statistical-physics Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 11, 2020 at 18:08 Abdelmalek Abdesselam 23.8k 1 1 gold badge 73 73 silver badges 137 137 bronze badges asked Jul 11, 2020 at 12:22 Frederik Ravn Klausen 1,086 7 7 silver badges 15 15 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 2 $\\begingroup$ One example is the Wolff measure, as described in this paper ; see the remark following the statement of Theorem 3.3. $\\endgroup$ Yvan Velenik –  Yvan Velenik 2020-07-12 18:03:05 +00:00 Commented Jul 12, 2020 at 18:03 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
