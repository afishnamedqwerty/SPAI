  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - Are schematic fixed points of a torus action on an affinized twistor deformation flat?",
  "body": "This is a follow-up to some earlier questions about flatness of schematic fixed points of certain deformations. Since I could never come up with good enough hypotheses in those examples, let me try a much more restrictive set of examples. Assume $X$ is a quasi-projective symplectic variety which is projective over its affinization (algebraically convex) with $H^i(X;\\mathcal{O}_X)=0$ for $i>0$ over a field $k$ of characteristic 0, $L$ is a line bundle on $X$, there is a Hamiltonian action of a torus $T$ on $X$, and a commuting action of $\\mathbb{G}_m$ which is conformal of weight $n$ (the symplectic form is a weight vector of weight $n$ for it) and has positive weight on all global functions. A theorem of Kaledin tells us that $X$ possesses an essentially unique twistor deformation , that is a flat deformation $\\mathcal X\\to S$ where $S=\\mathrm{Spec} ( k[[t]])$ with an extension of $L$ to a line bundle $\\mathcal{L}$ such that $\\mathcal X$ is Poisson with the coordinate $t$ being Poisson central. $\\mathcal L$ is a Poisson module with $\\{t,-\\}$ inducing the identity map. The action of $T\\times \\mathbb{G}_m$ extends to an action of the Lie algebra of this group on $\\mathcal X$ lifting the action on $S$ where $T$ acts trivially and $\\mathbb{G}_m$ acts with weight 1 on $t$ (here you see why I had to use the Lie algebras instead of the algebraic groups). The global functions $A=\\Gamma(\\mathcal X)$ are also flat over $k[[t]]$, $t$-adically complete and normal. If you're having trouble imagining what this looks like, the point is to \"invert Hamiltonian reduction.\" The total space of $\\mathcal{L}$ minus its 0-section is symplectic, and its induced $\\mathbb{G}_m$-action (by scalar multiplication; this has nothing to do with the one we introduced before) is Hamiltonian with moment map $t$. The variety $X$ is the Hamiltonian reduction for this action. We can take schematic fixed points $B$ of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak t$ acting on $A$; this is the quotient of $A$ by the ideal generated by $y\\cdot a-a$ for $y\\in \\mathfrak t, a\\in A$. This is an algebra over $k[[t]]$. Is $B$ flat over $k[[t]]$? ag.algebraic-geometry sg.symplectic-geometry torus-action moment-map deformation-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Apr 13, 2017 at 12:58 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Dec 16, 2010 at 22:19 Ben Webster 45.6k 13 13 gold badges 134 134 silver badges 264 264 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ This thing with the bounty doesn't seem to work that well, does it? $\\endgroup$ André Henriques –  André Henriques 2011-02-04 17:06:11 +00:00 Commented Feb 4, 2011 at 17:06 $\\begingroup$ Nope, apparently I ask questions that are too hard.
