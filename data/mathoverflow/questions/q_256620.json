  "body": "Let $\\Omega$ be an open subset of $\\mathbb R^d$, let $U$ be an open subset of $\\mathbb C$ and let $f:\\Omega\\times U\\rightarrow\\mathbb C$ be a $C^\\infty$ function which is holomorphic with respect to $\\zeta$ on $U$. Let me assume that for some $(x_0,\\zeta_0)\\in \\Omega\\times U$, $$ f(x_0,\\zeta_0)=0,\\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\zeta}(x_0,\\zeta_0)\\not=0. $$ I want to show that there exists a smooth function $\\lambda$ defined near $x_0$ such that $\\lambda(x_0)=\\zeta_0$ and $$ f(x,\\zeta)=e_0(x,\\zeta)(\\zeta-\\lambda(x)), $$ where $e_0$ is a $C^\\infty$ non-vanishing function defined near $(x_0,\\zeta_0)$ which is holomorphic with respect to $\\zeta$ and $\\lambda$ is a $C^\\infty$ function defined near $x_0$. This is obvious when $f$ is analytic by the holomorphic implicit function theorem. However, with $f$ only $C^\\infty$ with respect to $x$, I would like to avoid resorting to sophisticated arguments such as the Malgrange Preparation Theorem. real-analysis cv.complex-variables implicit-function-theorem weierstrass-preparation Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Mar 30, 2019 at 13:57 YCor 67.5k 5 5 gold badges 203 203 silver badges 301 301 bronze badges asked Dec 7, 2016 at 13:26 Bazin 16.7k 1 1 gold badge 33 33 silver badges 70 70 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 $\\begingroup$ Just as in the case of holomorphic implicit function theorem the function lambda will be the integral over a circle in the zeta plane of zeta times the logarithmic derivative of f wrt zeta normalized suitably. $\\endgroup$ Mohan Ramachandran –  Mohan Ramachandran 2016-12-08 02:25:08 +00:00 Commented Dec 8, 2016 at 2:25 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
