  "body": "Motivation: Consider the ODE $$y'(t)=Ay(t)$$ then it is true that the flow satisfies $\\Phi(t)y_0=e^{tA}y_0$ and the adjoint of the flow is a solution to the adjoint equation $$y'(t)=A^*y(t).$$ I would like to understand whether something like this is true in a more general context: Given the linear ODE in a Hilbert space $H$ $$y'(t)=Ay(t)+By(t)\\kappa(t)$$ where $A$ is the generator of a $C_0$ semigroup and $B$ a bounded operator $B:H \\rightarrow H$ is bounded and $\\kappa \\in C_c^{\\infty}$ a scalar function. The solution for some initial state $y_0$ can be expressed in terms of a flow $y(t)=\\Phi(t)y_0.$ Thus, $\\Phi(t):H \\rightarrow H$ and one can consider the adjoint operator $\\Phi(t)^*.$ It is very tempting to assume that the adjoint flow operator solves $$y'(t)=A^*y(t)+B^*y(t) \\kappa(t).$$ Is this true? The problem is that the solution can often only be expressed as a mild or weak solution. The weak solution for example reads for $x \\in D(A^*)$ $$\\langle \\Phi(t)y_0,x\\rangle = \\langle y_0,x \\rangle + \\int_0^t \\langle \\Phi(s)y_0, A^*x+\\kappa(s) B^*x \\rangle ds$$ and I do not see how to infer anything from this formualtion about $\\Phi(t)^*.$ fa.functional-analysis real-analysis ap.analysis-of-pdes ds.dynamical-systems semigroups-of-operators Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Feb 8, 2020 at 13:33 YCor 67.5k 5 5 gold badges 203 203 silver badges 301 301 bronze badges asked Apr 11, 2018 at 16:03 Umberto 83 3 3 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ A terminological remark: since the linear equation $$y'(t)=Ay(t)+\\kappa(t)By(t)$$ is nonautonomous, one cannot speak of the flow generated by it.

If $\\Phi(t)$ denotes the solution operator (i.e. $y(t)=\\Phi(t)y(0)$, then $\\Phi'(t)=A(t)\\Phi(t)$, so $(\\Phi^*)'(t)=\\Phi^*(t)A^*(t)$. In the autonomous case, the operators $\\Phi^*$ and $A^*$ commute, but you cannot expect this in a non-autonomous system. $\\endgroup$ Michael Renardy –  Michael Renardy 2020-02-08 21:44:48 +00:00 Commented Feb 8, 2020 at 21:44 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
