  "title": "The following ODE global existence theorem reference?",
  "body": "There is an ODE existence theorem of the form: Let $f:[a,b]\\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a Caratheodory function. Suppose that there is a constant $c$ such that if $y$ is a solution, then $|y(t)| \\leq c$ on any subinterval of $[a,b]$ . Furthermore, if $|v| \\leq C$ , there is a $h_C \\in L^1$ such that $|f(t,v)| \\leq h_C(t)$ . Then the ODE $y'(t) = f(t,y(t))$ with $y(0)=y_0$ has a global solution on $[a,b]$ (solution here means the equation holds pointwise a.e.). Does anyone know of a reference for this statment (apart from Zeidler)? I am particularly needing the condition about $h_C$ with the integrability bound only on a ball of radius $C$ .
