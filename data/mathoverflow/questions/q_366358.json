  "title": "algebraic number theory - Is semi-simplicity of Galois representations local?",
  "body": "Let $\\rho:G_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\rightarrow \\text{Gl}(V)$ be a finite dimensional $\\ell$ -adic Galois representation. Then for each prime, by pre-composing $\\rho$ with the natural inclusion $G_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}\\rightarrow G_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ , we get a representation of the local Galois group. I'm curious about how the property of being semisimple behaves under localization, that is to say if $\\rho$ is semisimple, can we conclude that $\\rho\\vert_{G_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}}$ is semisimple? Conversely, if for all $p\\neq \\ell$ (or maybe all primes) $\\rho_{G_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}}$ is semisimple, does it follow that $\\rho$ is semisimple? If I'm not mistaken, all the $\\rho_{G_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}}$ being semisimple implies that $\\rho\\vert_{\\bigcup_p G_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}}$ is semistable, and since ${\\bigcup_p G_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}}$ is of finite index in $G_\\mathbb{Q}$ (I think), this would mean $\\rho$ is semisimple. algebraic-number-theory galois-theory galois-representations absolute-galois-group Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 23, 2020 at 9:51 curious math guy 4,438 10 10 silver badges 36 36 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 2 $\\begingroup$ If $E/\\mathbf{Q}$ is a non-CM elliptic curve and $\\ell>3$ is a prime where $E$ has good ordinary reduction, then $V_\\ell E$ is a semisimple $G_\\mathbf{Q}$-representation but it is not semisimple as a $G_{\\mathbf{Q}_\\ell}$-representation. $\\endgroup$ David Hansen –  David Hansen 2020-07-23 10:01:38 +00:00 Commented Jul 23, 2020 at 10:01 3 $\\begingroup$ If a newform $f$ is ordinary at $p$ then the local Galois representation at $p$ is upper-triangular (Deligne, Mazur-Wiles) but usually it does not split.
