It looks that the bound $C^n/n^D$ for the coefficients should be provable by induction, looking at the relation for the new coefficient $a_n$. $\\endgroup$ Fedor Petrov –  Fedor Petrov 2020-08-01 07:34:11 +00:00 Commented Aug 1, 2020 at 7:34 3 $\\begingroup$ @FedorPetrov Indeed, this is, e.g., proposition 2 in these notes (Peter Roquette, “On convergent power series”, 1996-07-16). $\\endgroup$ Gro-Tsen –  Gro-Tsen 2020-08-01 10:02:59 +00:00 Commented Aug 1, 2020 at 10:02 2 $\\begingroup$ All series with zero radius of convergence are transcendental over $C(X)$. $\\endgroup$ Alexandre Eremenko –  Alexandre Eremenko 2020-08-01 13:15:30 +00:00 Commented Aug 1, 2020 at 13:15 1 $\\begingroup$ Wahoo. Thanks for these very accurate answers. Roquette's paper is very impressive. $\\endgroup$ joaopa –  joaopa 2020-08-01 18:47:45 +00:00 Commented Aug 1, 2020 at 18:47 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
