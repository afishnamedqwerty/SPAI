  "body": "Let $B$ the interior of a Polyhedron in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ . Suppose $a^{ij} \\in C^\\infty (\\overline{B})$ , $a^{ij}(x)y_i y_j \\geq \\lambda |y|^2$ $\\forall x\\in B, \\ \\ y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ . Set $\\Gamma := \\cup _i \\Gamma _i $ , where $\\Gamma _i$ is the interior of a face of $\\overline{B}$ . Suppose also that $c\\in L^q (B)$ , $c_1 \\in L^{q_1} (\\partial B -\\overline{\\Gamma})$ for same $q$ , $q_1 > n-1$ . Consider the following problem \\begin{equation} \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{rl} -(a^{ij}u_{x_i})_{x_j} + c u = f & \\mbox{on} \\ B\\\\ u=g & \\mathrm{in\\ } \\Gamma\\\\ a^{ij}u_{x_i} \\nu _j + c_1u=h & \\mathrm{in\\ } \\partial B - \\overline{\\Gamma} \\ \\ \\ \\ (\\nu \\ \\ \\mbox{is a outward-pointing vector to } \\ B) \\end{array} \\right. \\end{equation} If $f\\in C(B)\\cap L^\\infty (B) $ and $g,h \\in C(\\overline{B})$ then a solution of the mixed problem above is continous on $\\overline{B}$ ??
