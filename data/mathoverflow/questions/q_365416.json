  "body": "How can we determine the subgroup of $PGL(\\wedge^2 \\bar{\\mathbb Q}^n)$ which preserves the grassmamnnian $Gr(2, n)$ embedded as a projective variety in $\\wedge^2(\\bar{\\mathbb Q}^n)$ via the Plucker embedding. For $n = 4$ , this variety is a quadric and it is a known fact that the transformation group of $Gr(2,4)$ is the orthogonal group of the corresponding quadratic form (defined on $\\bar{\\mathbb Q}^6$ by a single Plucker relation). One may approach this question for $n = 5$ by considering the Plucker relations for $n = 5$ each of which yields a quadratic form and provided this is non-degenerate determine the corresponding orthogonal groups and finally take their intersection. Is this a good approach. Is there an alternative method? ag.algebraic-geometry linear-algebra grassmannians multilinear-algebra Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 12, 2020 at 10:49 asked Jul 11, 2020 at 17:12 A.

The question would be more appropriate on MSE . $\\endgroup$ abx –  abx 2020-07-11 18:15:36 +00:00 Commented Jul 11, 2020 at 18:15 1 $\\begingroup$ This is of course true. Here we are actually seeking a subgroup of $PGL(\\binom{n}{2}, \\bar{\\mathbb Q})$ that preserves the image of $Gr(2,n)$ in $\\wedge^2 (\\bar{\\mathbb Q}^n)$. This is a non-trivial question (e.g. W. Nemitz Transformations Preserving the Grassmannian William C. Nemitz, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society Vol. 109, No. 3 (Dec., 1963), pp. 400-410) $\\endgroup$ A. Gupta –  A.

For n = 4 Hodge-star operator is also preserving. $\\endgroup$ A. Gupta –  A.
