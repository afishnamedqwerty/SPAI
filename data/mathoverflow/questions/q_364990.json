  "body": "Let $f:\\mathbb{R}^d\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function and $\\mathrm{supp}(f) := \\mathrm{cl}\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^d\\mid f(x)\\neq 0\\}$ its support. Under which conditions is it true that $f≠0$ (Lebesgue-) almost everywhere on $\\mathrm{supp}(f)$ ? (I.e., under which conditions on $f$ is the set $\\{x\\in\\mathrm{supp}(f)\\mid f(x)=0\\}$ necessarily a Lebesgue nullset?) gn.general-topology real-analysis measure-theory geometric-measure-theory multivariable-calculus Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 6, 2020 at 20:54 fsp-b 453 2 2 silver badges 8 8 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ If the support is compact, this happens iff the support is Jordan measurable. $\\endgroup$ Liviu Nicolaescu –  Liviu Nicolaescu 2020-07-06 20:56:35 +00:00 Commented Jul 6, 2020 at 20:56 $\\begingroup$ @LiviuNicolaescu : Thank you.
