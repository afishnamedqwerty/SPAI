It should be of codimension 2 in $G(3,6)$. is not smooth and its singular locus is the strata $\\{L \\in G(3,6), \\ L \\supset A \\}$. There is a huge litterature on degeneracy loci $\\endgroup$ Libli –  Libli 2020-07-15 14:29:25 +00:00 Commented Jul 15, 2020 at 14:29 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
