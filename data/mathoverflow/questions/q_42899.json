  "body": "Let $f(z_1,\\dots,z_n)$ be a polynomial with $p$-adic coefficients, and let $g(z):=log\\lvert f(z) \\rvert$. If $\\xi$ is a complex character of $\\mathbb{Z}_p^n$ there exists a number $v=v(\\xi)$ such that $\\xi$ is trivial on $p^v\\mathbb{Z}_p^n$, but not on $p^{v-1}\\mathbb{Z}_p^n$. The question is: Find an upper bound of $\\lvert\\hat{g}(\\xi)\\rvert$ in terms of $v(\\xi)$. If $f$ is a polynomial in one variable, then I get $\\lvert\\hat{g}(\\xi)\\rvert \\ll p^{-v(\\xi)}$ The solution is quite simple: One solves the problem for f(z)=z, in which case $\\hat g(\\xi)$ can be explicitly computed. The general case then follows easily, because we can factor f into linear factors times a non-vanishing function. This solution, however, doesn't work in higher dimensions. My guess is that the same bound holds for higher dimensions, but I still haven't managed to show that. Has this problem already been solved? Do you know of any books or papers that might be helpful? Any help would be appreciated.
