  "body": "Let $X$ be a topological space, $Z$ be a compact convex subset of $\\mathbb R^m$ , and let $f:X \\times Z \\to \\mathbb R$ be a continuous function (w.r.t the product topology on $X \\times Z$ ). Question. Under what minimal additional assumptions do we have the duality $\\sup_{z \\in Z}\\inf_{x \\in X}f(x,z) = \\inf_{x \\in X}\\sup_{z \\in Z}f(x,z)$ ? The case $m=1$ (in which case $Z$ must be a compact interval in $\\mathbb R$ ) was proved in Theorem 1 of Minimax theorems in a fully non-convex setting under additional connectivity conditions on the sets $\\arg\\min f(\\cdot,z)$ and $\\arg\\max f(x,\\cdot)$ for all $(x,z) \\in X \\times Z$ . fa.functional-analysis convex-optimization convex-analysis Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 3, 2020 at 19:14 asked Jul 3, 2020 at 15:26 dohmatob 7,053 1 1 gold badge 20 20 silver badges 87 87 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 2 $\\begingroup$ shouldn't sup and inf be changed on the RHS? $\\endgroup$ user35593 –  user35593 2020-07-03 16:44:31 +00:00 Commented Jul 3, 2020 at 16:44 $\\begingroup$ Good catch.
