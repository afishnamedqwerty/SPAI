  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - Infinite sum in power series ring",
  "body": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$ , $R[[x]]$ be the power series ring over $R$ and $A$ be an (prime) ideal of $R[[x]]$ with $x\\not\\in A$ and $\\{f_i\\}_{i=1}^\\infty$ be a sequence of element of $A$ . Now I have two questions: Is $f\\mathrel{:=}f_1+xf_2+x^2f_3+\\dotsb+x^nf_{n+1}+\\dotsb$ a well defined element of $R[[x]]$ ? (Since we can find the coefficient of $x^n$ in $f$ for each $n$ , it seems that $f$ is well defined.) If (1) is true is $f\\in A$ ? (If (1) is true and (2) is not true, under what conditions is (2) true?) ag.algebraic-geometry ac.commutative-algebra power-series Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 21, 2020 at 16:25 asked Jul 21, 2020 at 16:11 Alice 31 2 2 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 4 $\\begingroup$ The usual definition of the topology on $R[[x]]$ sets its ideals $x^n R[[x]]$ as a neighbourhood base at the identity. According to that definition, the answer to (1) is obviously yes. For (2), of course the answer is that $A$ should be closed, but I don't know if there's a nice characterisation of closed ideals in $R[[x]]$. $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-07-21 16:20:03 +00:00 Commented Jul 21, 2020 at 16:20 1 $\\begingroup$ Here is at least some characterization (not sure it can be called \"nice\"): An ideal $I$ is in $R[[x]]$ is closed in the $x$-adic topology if and only if $\\bigcap_{n \\geq 1} I + (x)^n = I$. $\\endgroup$ AlexIvanov –  AlexIvanov 2020-07-23 21:00:05 +00:00 Commented Jul 23, 2020 at 21:00 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
