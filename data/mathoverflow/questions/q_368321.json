And I suppose you also want an initial condition? $\\endgroup$ Michael Renardy –  Michael Renardy 2020-08-04 17:01:10 +00:00 Commented Aug 4, 2020 at 17:01 1 $\\begingroup$ Thanks @MichaelRenardy. The existing solution $\\varphi$ that I found is a probability density (modelling the transition probability of a stochastic system to jump from state $x$ to state $y$ in $t>0$ units of time). Yes, I want the boundary at $t=T$ only. $\\endgroup$ cts12 –  cts12 2020-08-04 17:14:32 +00:00 Commented Aug 4, 2020 at 17:14 1 $\\begingroup$ Writing $\\phi=\\log v$ leads to the heat equation $v_t=v_{xx}$ but the boundary condition looks more complicate. $\\endgroup$ Giorgio Metafune –  Giorgio Metafune 2020-08-10 08:32:16 +00:00 Commented Aug 10, 2020 at 8:32 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
