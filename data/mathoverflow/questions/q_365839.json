  "body": "Let $\\mathscr{C}$ be a cover of $\\mathbf{N}=\\{1,2,\\dotsc,N\\}$ by finite subsets $S\\in \\mathscr{C}$ with $2\\leq |S|\\leq K$ , where we write $|S|$ for the number of elements of $S$ . Assume no element of $\\mathbf{N}$ is contained in more than $K'$ elements of $\\mathscr{C}$ . Given a subset $Z\\subset \\mathbf{N}$ , we define the boundary $\\partial Z$ of $Z$ to be the set of elements $n\\in Z$ such that $n+1\\not\\in Z$ . Assume that every $S\\in \\mathscr{C}$ satisfies $|\\partial S|>|S|/2$ . Define a graph $\\Gamma$ with elements of $\\mathscr{C}$ as vertices, having an edge between $S,S'\\in \\mathscr{C}$ iff there are $n\\in S$ , $n'\\in S'$ such that $n'\\in \\{n-1,n,n+1\\}$ . Under what conditions is it the case that there must be a subset $\\mathscr{D}\\subset\\mathscr{C}$ such that (a) the subgraph $\\Gamma|_\\mathscr{D}$ is connected and (b) the boundary of $\\bigcup \\mathscr{D}$ is large (meaning $\\gg N$ , say)? (A satisfactory solution to the case $K'=1$ is given by Existence of connected component with large boundary? In brief, it is then enough for every vertex of $\\Gamma$ to have degree $\\geq 3$ . The condition can be easily relaxed: for $K'=1$ , it is enough for $\\Gamma$ to have many surviving vertices of degree $\\geq 3$ after we repeatedly prune all vertices of degree $1$ .) co.combinatorics graph-theory extremal-graph-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 21, 2020 at 12:21 asked Jul 17, 2020 at 8:53 H A Helfgott 22.1k 4 4 gold badges 49 49 silver badges 143 143 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ One option is to simply work with the subgraph $\\Gamma'\\subset \\Gamma$ having $\\mathscr{C}$ as its set of vertices and an edge between $S$ and $S'$ only when there are $n\\in S$, $n'\\in S'$ such that $n' = n\\pm 1$. Then one can try applying mathoverflow.net/questions/362168/… . Then one obtains $\\mathscr{D}$ such that $\\Gamma'|_\\mathscr{D}$ (and hence $\\Gamma|_\\mathscr{D}$) is connected, and $\\mathscr{D}$ has large boundary in $\\Gamma'$. The problem is that that does not guarantee that $\\partial(\\bigcup \\mathscr{D})$ is large. $\\endgroup$ H A Helfgott –  H A Helfgott 2020-07-17 09:12:13 +00:00 Commented Jul 17, 2020 at 9:12 $\\begingroup$ I think you meant that no element of $\\mathbf{N}$ is contained in more than $K'$ elements of $\\mathscr{C}$ instead of \"no element of $\\mathbf{N}$ is contained in more than $K'$ elements of $\\mathbf{N}$\", right? $\\endgroup$ vidyarthi –  vidyarthi 2020-07-20 15:40:21 +00:00 Commented Jul 20, 2020 at 15:40 $\\begingroup$ What is a precise definition of 'large boundary'?
