  "body": "Let $A$ be a polynomial algebra in $n$ variables over field $\\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic zero which is algebraically closed. Assume that $a_1,\\ldots, a_n, b_1,\\ldots, b_n\\in A$ are such that $a_1b_1+\\ldots+ a_nb_n=1$ . Consider the free left $A$ -module $_{A}M$ with basis $r_1,\\ldots, r_n$ . From Suslin-Quillen theorem we know that $_{A}M/(A(a_1r_1+\\ldots+a_nr_n))$ is free $A$ -module of rank $n-1$ . $\\bf{Question.}$ Is there any formula of a basis of this module in terms of $a_i, b_i$ ? ac.commutative-algebra modules Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 7, 2020 at 20:30 asked Jul 7, 2020 at 16:53 solver6 291 2 2 silver badges 11 11 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 10 1 $\\begingroup$ No, it is what is known as a stably free module, but in general not free. The standard example is the tangent bundle of the real sphere. Let $A=\\mathbb{R}[x,y,z]/(x^2+y^2+z^2-1)$ and take $a_1=x, a_2=y, a_3=z$. $\\endgroup$ Mohan –  Mohan 2020-07-07 17:00:25 +00:00 Commented Jul 7, 2020 at 17:00 $\\begingroup$ Is there any such examples if $\\mathbb{F}$ is algebraically closed.

If $A$ is not a polynomial ring, there are many such, even for algebras over algebraically closed fields. $\\endgroup$ Mohan –  Mohan 2020-07-07 17:41:19 +00:00 Commented Jul 7, 2020 at 17:41 $\\begingroup$ I edited the question. $\\endgroup$ solver6 –  solver6 2020-07-07 17:43:49 +00:00 Commented Jul 7, 2020 at 17:43 $\\begingroup$ As I said, this is true, and the characteristic of the field is irrelevant. $\\endgroup$ Mohan –  Mohan 2020-07-07 17:48:27 +00:00 Commented Jul 7, 2020 at 17:48  |  Show 5 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
