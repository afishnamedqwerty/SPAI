  "title": "ap.analysis of pdes - Marcinkiewicz-Mihlin-Hormander Fourier multiplier theorem",
  "body": "I'm trying to understand the hypothesis of the Marcinkiewicz-Mihlin-Hörmander multiplier theorem. See for instance Theorem A in this paper of Elias Stein. Theorem A : Assume that $m: (0, \\infty)\\to \\mathbb R$ satisfies the following equation $$ |m^{(j)}(x)| \\leq C x^{-j}\\quad0 \\leq j \\leq k,\\; k>\\frac{d}{2},\\label{1}\\tag{1} $$ rr more generally $$ \\sup_{t>0} \\|\\chi m(t \\cdot)\\|_{L^2_{\\alpha}}< \\infty \\label{2}\\tag{2} $$ where $\\chi$ is a non-zero smooth cut-off function of compact support that vanishes near the origin. Then Fourier-multiplier operator $\\widehat{Tf}= m(|\\xi|^2) \\hat{f}$ is bounded on $L^p (\\mathbb R^d)$ for $1<p< \\infty.$ My questions are: (A) How to define $\\|\\cdot\\|_{L^2_{\\alpha}}$ ? Is it standard notation? (It seems that Stein has not defined this notation in his paper. Thus I guess it must be standard) (B) Why condition \\eqref{1} implies \\eqref{2} in Theorem A ? (C) Does symbol $m(\\xi)=e^{i|\\xi|^2}$ satisfy condition \\eqref{2} of Theorem A ? (I am interested in this problem since, by using this symbol, we can solve Schrodinger's equation) (D) How this theorem has been developed historically? I mean is it correct to say that the first version of this result goes back to Marcinkiewicz in 1939, and later versions were Mihlin's in 1957 and finally Hormander's in 1960? About question A above, my heuristic guess is that we can define $\\|f\\|_{L^2_{\\alpha}}^2$ as $$ \\|f\\|_{L^2_{\\alpha}}^2= \\int_{\\mathbb R^d} |f(x)|^2 (1+|x|^2)^{\\alpha} \\mathrm{d}x $$ or $$ \\|f\\|_{L^2_{\\alpha}}^2= \\int_{\\mathbb R^d} |\\widehat{f}(\\xi)|^2 (1+|\\xi|^2)^{\\alpha} \\mathrm{d}x $$ Is my guess correct or am I missing something? ap.analysis-of-pdes ho.history-overview harmonic-analysis notation Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 27, 2020 at 19:08 Daniele Tampieri 6,948 10 10 gold badges 35 35 silver badges 50 50 bronze badges asked Jun 27, 2020 at 13:40 Learn 161 5 5 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 $\\begingroup$ Your second definition of $L^2_\\alpha$ is right. Notice that $|\\partial^j(\\chi m(tx))|\\le\\sum_l c_lt^l|\\partial^{j-l}\\chi\\,(\\partial^l m)(tx)|\\le C\\sum_l|\\partial^{j-l}\\chi||x|^{-l}$ and the $L^2$-norm is uniformly bounded. The symbol $e^{i|\\xi|^2}$ doesn't satisfy the hypotheses; furthermore, the $L^p\\to L^p$ bound only holds for $p=2$; use examples $e^{i|x|^2}f$ for suitable functions $f$, say $f=1/(1+|x|^2)^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha<n/2$. $\\endgroup$ user90189 –  user90189 2020-06-27 16:54:47 +00:00 Commented Jun 27, 2020 at 16:54 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
