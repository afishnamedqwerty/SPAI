  "body": "Let $X$ be a compact measure space and $\\mathcal{O}(X)=\\{U\\subset X, \\textrm{U - open set}\\}$ and let $\\lambda$ : $\\mathcal{O}(X) \\rightarrow \\left[0,+\\infty\\right]$ be a metric outer measure. Prove that $\\mu^*(A)=\\inf_{A\\subset B\\in\\mathcal{O}(X)} \\lambda(B)$ is a metric outer measure. I have just troubles with the last condition: $A, ~B\\in \\mathcal{O}(X)~\\textrm{and}~\\rho(A,B)>0 \\Rightarrow \\mu^*(A\\cup B)=\\mu^*(A)+\\mu^*(B)$ , where $\\rho(A,B):=\\inf{\\{d(x,y):~x\\in A,~y \\in B\\}}.$ Do you know how to show it or find any sources containing the proof? measure-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jun 21, 2020 at 16:14 Norbert Dąbrowski 1 $\\endgroup$ 5 $\\begingroup$ you can consider the infinum only among the open sets that are positively separated from the other set $\\endgroup$ erz –  erz 2020-06-22 00:25:24 +00:00 Commented Jun 22, 2020 at 0:25 $\\begingroup$ I don't get it, can you explain more? $\\endgroup$ Norbert Dąbrowski –  Norbert Dąbrowski 2020-06-22 12:28:03 +00:00 Commented Jun 22, 2020 at 12:28 $\\begingroup$ Ok, first, i think you wat $\\mu^*$ to be defined for all sets, not just open, right? So let $A,B\\subset X$ be such that $\\rho(A,B)=r>0$. Let $A'=\\bigcup_{x\\in A} B(x,\\frac{r}{3})$ and $B'=\\bigcup_{x\\in B} B(x,\\frac{r}{3})$, which are open and $\\rho(A,B)\\ge \\frac{r}{3}>0$. Then $\\mu^*(A)$ can be calculated as infimum of $\\lambda(U)$, where $A\\subset U\\subset A'$, and same for $B$ and $B'$, as well as $A\\cup B$ and $A'\\cup B'$. $\\endgroup$ erz –  erz 2020-06-22 20:38:51 +00:00 Commented Jun 22, 2020 at 20:38 $\\begingroup$ I understand but I still can't see why the condition is satisfied according to what you have written. $\\endgroup$ Norbert Dąbrowski –  Norbert Dąbrowski 2020-06-24 19:32:41 +00:00 Commented Jun 24, 2020 at 19:32 $\\begingroup$ Okay, never mind.
