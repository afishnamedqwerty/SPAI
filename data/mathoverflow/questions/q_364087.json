  "body": "This question is about chasing down a reference in a paper relating to non-commutative crepant resolutions and Cohen-Macaulay representation theory. Allow me to first give a minor introduction. Let $(R, \\mathfrak m)$ be a commutative complete local Cohen-Macaulay ring. For a finitely generated $R$ -module $M$ , let $\\text{End}_R(M):=\\text{Hom}_R(M,M)$ be the endomorphism ring (this ring is Noetherian, albeit non-commutative) . A finitely generated $R$ -module $M$ is called maximal Cohen-Macaulay iff $\\text{depth}(M)=\\dim R$ . For any ring $S$ , let $\\text{gl}.\\dim (S)$ denote the global dimension of $S$ The global spectrum of $R$ is the set $$gs(R):=\\{n\\ge 0 :n=\\text{gl}.\\dim \\text{End}_R(M); M \\text{ is a maximal Cohen-Macaulay module over } R\\}$$ . In https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2016.03.020 , section 4.2, the authors calculate the global spectrum of $A_n : k[[x,y]]/(x^2+y^n), n\\ge 2$ , curve singularities using ladders and state that in the reference [11] the same characterization has been carried out using a general fact about triangulated categories, and I'd really like to know this alternative proof. So I look at the reference [11] and see that it is a paper in preparation by H.Dao and E.Faber , On global dimension of endomorphism rings. Now when I searched Google and arxiv with this title, nothing showed up. Does anyone know if this paper referenced [11] has been made available yet ?
