  "body": "Let $(E,d)$ be a locally compact separable metric space. We have a Markov process $X=(\\{X_t\\}_{t \\ge 0},\\{P_x\\}_{x \\in E})$ on $E$ . For bounded measurable function $f$ on $E$ , we define \\begin{align*} P_tf(x)&=E_{x}[f(X_t)],\\quad t>0,\\\\ R_{\\alpha}f(x)&=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\exp(-\\alpha t)P_tf(x)\\,dt,\\quad \\alpha>0. \\end{align*} We assume that for any bounded measurable function $f\\colon E \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\alpha>0$ , the function $R_{\\alpha}f$ is $\\lambda$ -Hölder continuous function on $(E,d)$ . That is, it holds that \\begin{align*} |R_{\\alpha}f(x)-R_{\\alpha}f(y)|\\le C\\|f\\|_{\\infty}d(x,y)^{\\lambda},\\quad x,y \\in E \\end{align*} Here, $\\lambda>0$ and $C>0$ are a positive constant independent of $x,y$ , and $f$ . We denote by $\\|f\\|_{\\infty}$ the sup-norm of $f$ . My question We assume that the Markov process $X$ is symmetric with respect to a $\\sigma$ -finite measure $m$ . Under the above conditions, the semigroup $P_tf(x)$ is also Hölder continuous in $x$ ? If the semigroup is ultracontractive in the sense that $P_t(L^1(E,m)) \\subset L^{\\infty}(E,m)$ , for any $t>0$ and $f \\in L^2(E,m)$ , we can find a bounded measurable function $h\\colon E \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $P_tf=R_{1}h$ . Therefore, then, the semigroup $P_tf(x)$ is also Hölder continuous in $x$ . Without the ultracontractivity, can we prove the Hölder continuity of $P_tf$ ? fa.functional-analysis stochastic-processes Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 11, 2020 at 10:22 asked Apr 3, 2020 at 12:20 sharpe 817 6 6 silver badges 21 21 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ What is the dependence of the constant $C$ on the function $f$? $\\endgroup$ John Dawkins –  John Dawkins 2020-04-03 14:56:29 +00:00 Commented Apr 3, 2020 at 14:56 $\\begingroup$ @JohnDawkins Thank you for your comment.
