  "body": "Let $t_1<t_2 \\in [0,T]$ , $f(t)\\ge0$ and $Z_t$ an increasing process with $Z_0= 0$ . We have clearly that \\begin{equation} \\int_{[0,t_2[}f(s)dZ_s \\ge \\chi_{t_1<T}(Z_{t_2} - Z_{t_1})\\min_{t_1\\le s \\le t_2}f(s) \\end{equation} holds. In a paper I'm reading the authors state based on this and using the fact that $Z_{t_1}\\ge0$ it follows that \\begin{equation} \\int_{[0,t_2[}f(s)dZ_s \\ge \\chi_{t_1<T}Z_{t_2}(\\min_{t_1 \\le s \\le t_2}(f(s) - f(t_2)) + f(t_2)) \\end{equation} holds. I'm confused how that can be, it seems like an error! Surely since $Z_{t_1}\\ge0$ we must have $(Z_{t_2} - Z_{t_1}) \\le Z_{t_2}?$ Would appreciate any insight into anything I may have glossed over here! For reference I am talking about the beginning of page 264 of the following paper: Boetius, Frederik, and Michael Kohlmann. \" Connections between optimal stopping and singular stochastic control .\" Stochastic Processes and their Applications 77.2 (1998): 253-281. stochastic-processes stochastic-calculus Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 25, 2020 at 20:30 asked Jul 25, 2020 at 20:15 icewater 23 3 3 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 9 $\\begingroup$ I see how to match the hypothesis at the top of p. 264 with yours, but I don't see why the conclusion matches. The notation is sufficiently involved that I can buy it, but are you sure that what you have written matches their conclusion $J_f \\ge \\chi_{\\sigma < T}(Z_\\sigma^x - Z_\\sigma^{x - \\delta})f(\\sigma) + \\delta I_5(\\delta) + \\delta I_6(\\delta)$? $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-07-25 20:33:05 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 20:33 1 $\\begingroup$ Hi LSpice, to give you more context: When they are writing $J_f \\ge \\chi_{\\sigma<T}(Z^x_\\sigma - Z^{x-\\delta}_\\sigma)f(\\sigma) + \\delta I_5(\\delta) + \\delta I_6(\\delta),$ by plugging in the terms we supposedly have $\\chi_{\\sigma^\\delta<T}(X^*_{\\sigma^\\delta} - Z^{x-\\delta}_\\sigma)f(\\sigma^\\delta) + \\int_{[0,\\sigma^\\delta[}f(s)d\\xi^*_s \\ge \\chi_{\\sigma^\\delta<T}(X^*_{\\sigma^\\delta} - Z^{x-\\delta}_{\\sigma^\\delta})f(\\sigma^\\delta) + \\chi_{\\sigma<T}\\xi^*_{\\sigma^\\delta}f(\\sigma^\\delta) + \\chi_{\\sigma<T}\\xi^*_{\\sigma^\\delta}\\min_{\\sigma \\le s \\le \\sigma^\\delta}(f(s) - f(\\sigma^\\delta))$ $\\endgroup$ icewater –  icewater 2020-07-25 20:51:11 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 20:51 1 $\\begingroup$ Yes I found it confusing too! I believe they are using it like so: $\\chi_{A}=1$ if $A$ is true and $\\chi_{A}=0$ otherwise. So yes $\\chi_{t_1<T}Z_{t_2}$ is a product. $\\endgroup$ icewater –  icewater 2020-07-25 21:01:40 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 21:01 1 $\\begingroup$ Yes I agree with you. I am wringing my hands making sense of this hieroglyphic paper for a dissertation, no one seemed to understand my plight. Apparently it has 57 citations, I wonder if the 57+ authors cracked this issue. In any case thanks a lot for your time LSpice, I really appreciate it! $\\endgroup$ icewater –  icewater 2020-07-25 21:18:54 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 21:18 1 $\\begingroup$ Thank you LSpice, that is a great suggestion. I am using a workaround for the time being by just writing $\\int_{[0,t_2[}f(s)d\\xi^*_s \\ge \\xi^*_{t_2}\\min_{0 \\le s \\le t_2}f(s)$ (since $\\xi^*_0=0$). $\\endgroup$ icewater –  icewater 2020-07-25 23:19:08 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 23:19  |  Show 4 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
