  "body": "Let $M^3$ be a smooth, closed 3-manifold. Given a smooth codimension-one foliation $\\mathcal{F}$ of $M$ , the Novikov compact leaf theorem asserts that, when the universal cover $\\widetilde{M}^3$ of $M^3$ is not contractible, the foliation $\\mathcal{F}$ contains a compact leaf of genus $g \\leq 1$ . What is the most basic example of a smooth codimension-one foliation with all noncompact leaves or leaves of higher genus on a smooth three manifold that has a contractible universal cover, such as the $3$ -torus? dg.differential-geometry smooth-manifolds 3-manifolds foliations Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 20, 2020 at 21:40 YCor 67.5k 5 5 gold badges 203 203 silver badges 301 301 bronze badges asked Jun 20, 2020 at 20:11 Daniel Santiago 105 5 5 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 3 $\\begingroup$ What about $\\Sigma_g\\times S^1$? $\\endgroup$ Michael Albanese –  Michael Albanese 2020-06-20 20:26:34 +00:00 Commented Jun 20, 2020 at 20:26 $\\begingroup$ Thank you! That answers the question of higher genus, but I am still confused about examples with all noncompact leaves. $\\endgroup$ Daniel Santiago –  Daniel Santiago 2020-06-20 20:46:45 +00:00 Commented Jun 20, 2020 at 20:46 3 $\\begingroup$ Just take the codimension one foliation of $T^2$ by non-compact leaves (of irrational slope), and cross with $S^1$. This gives a codimension one foliation of $T^3$ by $S^1\\times\\mathbb{R}$. $\\endgroup$ Michael Albanese –  Michael Albanese 2020-06-20 21:02:00 +00:00 Commented Jun 20, 2020 at 21:02 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
