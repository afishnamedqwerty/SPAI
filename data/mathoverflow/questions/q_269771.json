  "title": "positivity - Hilbert spaces over the semi-field $\\mathbb R_+$",
  "body": "Let $\\mathbb R_+$ be the semi-field of non-negative real numbers. Definition (preliminary): A Hilbert space over $\\mathbb R_+$ is a pair $(H,P)$ , where $H$ is a complex Hilbert space, and $P\\subset H$ is a self-dual cone: $$ P=\\{\\xi \\in H \\mid \\langle \\xi,\\eta\\rangle\\in \\mathbb R_+\\,\\,\\, \\forall \\eta \\in P\\}. $$ Example: Given a von Neumann algebra $A$ , its non-commutative $L^2$ -space $L^2(A)$ (also called the standard form of $A$ ) is equipped with a self-dual cone $P:=L^2_+(A)$ . Question (preliminary): Does there exist a reasonable notion of tensor product of Hilbert spaces over $\\mathbb R_+$ ? The underlying Hilbert space of $(H_1,P_1)\\otimes (H_2,P_2)$ should be the tensor product of the underlying Hilbert spaces and, given two von Neumann algebras $A_1$ and $A_2$ , the tensor product of $(L^2A_1,L^2_+(A_1))$ with $(L^2A_2,L^2_+(A_2))$ should be $(L^2(A_1\\otimes A_2),L^2_+(A_1\\otimes A_2))$ . I think that the answer to the above question is negative, and that the definition of a Hilbert space over $\\mathbb R_+$ was a bit too simplistic. Let $M_n(\\mathbb C)$ denote the algebra of $n\\times n$ matrices over $\\mathbb C$ . Definition: A Hilbert space over $\\mathbb R_+$ consists of a complex Hilbert space $H$ , along with a collection of of self-dual cones $P_n\\subset H\\otimes M_n(\\mathbb C)$ for every $n\\in\\mathbb N$ such that for every completely positive map $f:M_n(\\mathbb C)\\to M_m(\\mathbb C)$ the map $id_H\\otimes f$ sends $P_n$ to $P_m$ . Question: Does there now exist a reasonable notion of tensor product of Hilbert spaces over $\\mathbb R_+$ ? [Added later: I have a candidate definition for the tensor product of $(H,(P_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N})$ with $(K,(Q_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N})$ . Namely, on the Hilbert space $H\\otimes K$ , one puts the cones $R_n\\subset H\\otimes K \\otimes M_n(\\mathbb C)$ defined as the closed $\\mathbb R_+$ -linear span of the vectors $(1_{H\\otimes K}\\otimes f)(\\xi\\otimes\\eta)$ for $\\xi\\in P_m$ , $\\eta\\in Q_l$ and $f:M_{m l}(\\mathbb C)\\to M_n(\\mathbb C)$ a completely positive map. I don't know how to prove that the cones $R_n$ are self-dual, and would love to see a proof. ] hilbert-spaces positivity Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked May 14, 2017 at 20:23 André Henriques 45k 6 6 gold badges 134 134 silver badges 280 280 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
