  "title": "A question about chaining Vinogradov notation",
  "body": "This is not a research question, but I hope it is still legitimate to ask for this platform. Suppose $A(x)$ , $B(x)$ , $C(x)$ , $D(x)$ are positive-valued functions of $x$ , and $A(x) \\ll B(x)$ and $ C(x) \\ll D(x)$ , where $ \\ll$ is the Vinogradov symbol . Suppose, further, that $B(x) \\le C(x)$ . There are two ways of expressing these chain of \"inequalities\" in one line: $$ A(x) \\ll B(x) \\le C(x) \\ll D(x) $$ and $$ A(x) \\ll B(x) \\ll C(x) \\ll D(x) $$ The first has the advantage of being more precise, while at the same time could be misreading, in that the implied constant in $A(x) \\ll C(x)$ might not be taken to be $1$ . Is there a convention for writing such chains of \"inequalities\"? If so, which one of the two formulations is preferable? notation Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 29, 2020 at 22:44 LSpice 14k 4 4 gold badges 48 48 silver badges 76 76 bronze badges asked Jul 29, 2020 at 21:49 Keivan Karai 6,526 2 2 gold badges 38 38 silver badges 50 50 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 5 $\\begingroup$ At the risk of being pedantic, the preferable notation is the one that cannot be misinterpreted by the reader. In this case, I'd use $$A(x)\\ll B(x)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad B(x)\\le C(x)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad C(x)\\ll D(x).$$ While maybe a little more to write, it has the advantage of being unambiguous. $\\endgroup$ Joe Silverman –  Joe Silverman 2020-07-29 22:40:16 +00:00 Commented Jul 29, 2020 at 22:40 1 $\\begingroup$ You refer to the implied constant in $A(x) \\ll C(x)$, but I think you mean the implied constant in $B(x) \\ll C(x)$. $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-07-29 22:43:05 +00:00 Commented Jul 29, 2020 at 22:43 $\\begingroup$ What I meant was that a reader may simply drop $B(x) $ and deduces that $A(x) \\le C(s)$, which, of course, does not have to be the case. I understand that this would be highly unlikely, but I am trying to be on the safe side by considering all possibilities. $\\endgroup$ Keivan Karai –  Keivan Karai 2020-07-30 07:36:03 +00:00 Commented Jul 30, 2020 at 7:36 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
