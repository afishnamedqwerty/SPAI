  "body": "Let $R$ be a topological ring of characteristic zero. Assume that $R$ is commutative. Let $G :R \\times R \\to R$ be a continuous function satisfying $G(G(x,y),z)=G(x,G(y,z))$ and $G(0,x)=x$ , for all $x,y,z \\in R$ . If we assume that $G$ is a convergent power series then $G$ is also a formal group law and the Honda's argument(cf. Hazewinkel, \"Formal Groups and Applications\", Chapter 1, 5.8, p.37) proves that G admits a logarithm, i.e. $G(x,y)=h^{-1}(h(x)+h(y))$ . Question : Does $G$ admit a logarithm if it is only continuous? EDIT Assuming that $G$ is continuous, what are the additional assumptions that should be made on $R$ and $G$ to guarantee the existence of logarithms? ac.commutative-algebra functional-equations topological-rings Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 10, 2020 at 3:52 asked Aug 9, 2020 at 16:29 A413 433 1 1 gold badge 4 4 silver badges 14 14 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 3 $\\begingroup$ But if $G$ is only continuous then the ring structure plays no rôle at all $\\endgroup$ მამუკა ჯიბლაძე –  მამუკა ჯიბლაძე 2020-08-09 18:18:38 +00:00 Commented Aug 9, 2020 at 18:18 3 $\\begingroup$ As @მამუკაჯიბლაძე says: If $R $ has the discrete topology, then continuity means nothing, and we are just requiring that $G $ is a binary operation that makes $R $ a semigroup with left identity $0$. Such operations exist in abundance; not all of them are groups, so not all of them have logarithms. $\\endgroup$ darij grinberg –  darij grinberg 2020-08-09 18:22:24 +00:00 Commented Aug 9, 2020 at 18:22 $\\begingroup$ What about $R=Q_p$? $\\endgroup$ A413 –  A413 2020-08-09 18:40:51 +00:00 Commented Aug 9, 2020 at 18:40 1 $\\begingroup$ For $Q_p$ you get arbitrary topological semigroup structure on the Cantor set with a point removed. $\\endgroup$ მამუკა ჯიბლაძე –  მამუკა ჯიბლაძე 2020-08-09 19:35:18 +00:00 Commented Aug 9, 2020 at 19:35 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
