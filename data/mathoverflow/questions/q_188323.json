  "title": "gn.general topology - A question on extension of $Z^{*}$ algebras",
  "body": "A $Z^{*}$ algebra is a $C^{*}$ algebra which all elements are(two sided or equivalently one sided) zero divisor. Are there two $Z^{*}$ algebras $A,B$ such that for every short exact sequence of $C^{*}$ algebras: $$0\\to A \\to C \\to B \\to 0$$ $C$ is a $Z^{*}$ algebra, too? In particular is there an extension of $C_{0}(X)$ by itself which is not a $Z^{*}$ algebra where $X$ is the long line ? This is already aked here as a comment but we ask it here as an independent question. Edit:When a commutative algebra $A$ is in the form of $A=C_{0}(X)$ , we get a formulation of our question in terms of general topology as follows: Assume that $X,Y,Z$ are three locally compact Hausdorff spaces. We say that $Z$ is an extension of $X$ by $Y$ if $X$ can be embedded as an open set in $Z$ which remainder is homeomorphic to $Y$ . We say that $X$ is approximately sigma compact (briefly A $\\sigma$ C) if there is a sequence of compact sets $K_{n}\\subset X$ such that $\\bigcup K_{n}$ is dense in $X$ . Our question is the following: Are there two NON $A\\sigma C$ spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that every extension of $X$ by $Y$ is NON $A\\sigma C$ ? Remark: An alternative terminology: \"Extension of $Y$ by $X$ \" can be replaced by \"Extension of $X$ by $Y$ \" gn.general-topology oa.operator-algebras c-star-algebras operator-theory extension Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Nov 28, 2014 at 18:34 Ali Taghavi 1 $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
