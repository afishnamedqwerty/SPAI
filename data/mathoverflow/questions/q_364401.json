  "body": "I am considering the classical form of the stationary Navier-Stokes equation given by $$\\frac{1}{Re} (\\nabla v, \\nabla \\phi) + ((v \\cdot \\nabla) v, \\phi) - (p, \\nabla \\cdot \\phi) = (f,\\phi);\\qquad (\\nabla \\cdot v, \\xi) = 0.$$ Now, for suitable Reynolds numbers, one can treat the nonlinearity by linearization, e.g. Stokes linearization $(v^{k-1} \\cdot \\nabla) v^{k-1}$ or Oseen linearization $(v^{k-1} \\cdot \\nabla) v^k$ . My question: is it also possible to consider a linearization of the form: $(v^k \\cdot \\nabla) v^{k-1}$ ? ap.analysis-of-pdes navier-stokes Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 29, 2020 at 11:07 YCor 67.5k 5 5 gold badges 203 203 silver badges 301 301 bronze badges asked Jun 29, 2020 at 9:54 Frieder 11 2 2 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 1 $\\begingroup$ I thought the Oseen approximation substitutes $v=U+\\delta v$ and linearizes in $\\delta v$ assuming $\\nabla U=0$, so $(v\\cdot\\nabla)v\\rightarrow (U\\cdot\\nabla)\\delta v$ without a term $(\\delta v\\cdot\\nabla)U$. $\\endgroup$ Carlo Beenakker –  Carlo Beenakker 2020-06-29 10:21:45 +00:00 Commented Jun 29, 2020 at 10:21 1 $\\begingroup$ Of course it is possible, but what would be the point? $\\endgroup$ Michael Renardy –  Michael Renardy 2020-06-29 10:52:00 +00:00 Commented Jun 29, 2020 at 10:52 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
