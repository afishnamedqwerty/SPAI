  "body": "Let $A$ be a symmetric linear operator of norm $\\leq 1$ on the space of functions $f:S\\to \\mathbb{R}$ , where $S$ is a set with $N$ elements. Define the inner product $\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle$ by letting $\\{x\\}$ have measure $1/N$ for each $x\\in S$ . Assume that, for every function $f$ such that $|f|_2=1$ and $|f|_\\infty\\leq K$ , we have $|\\langle f,A f\\rangle|\\leq \\alpha$ . Does it follow that there must be a $Y\\subset S$ of measure $O(1/K)$ (say) such that, for $X = S\\setminus Y$ and any $f:S\\to \\mathbb{R}$ with $|f|_2=1$ , $$|\\langle f|_X, A(f|_X)\\rangle|\\leq 10 \\alpha,$$ say? fa.functional-analysis linear-algebra eigenvalues eigenvector Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 5, 2020 at 6:32 asked Aug 4, 2020 at 9:28 H A Helfgott 22.1k 4 4 gold badges 49 49 silver badges 143 143 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ Why doesn't this hold just by homoeneity for $Y=\\emptyset $? And how do you define $A (f|_X) $? Do you put the restriction as $0$ outside $X $? $\\endgroup$ Jochen Wengenroth –  Jochen Wengenroth 2020-08-04 17:23:58 +00:00 Commented Aug 4, 2020 at 17:23 $\\begingroup$ I'm not sure how homogeneity would be enough - $A$ could have eigenfunctions with enormous peaks. Sure, define $A(f|_X)$ that way if you wish -- it doesn't matter, since you are going to take the inner product with $f|_X$. $\\endgroup$ H A Helfgott –  H A Helfgott 2020-08-04 18:03:02 +00:00 Commented Aug 4, 2020 at 18:03 $\\begingroup$ I must misunderstand something. For $t=K/|f|_\\infty$ one has $|tf|_\\infty\\le K$ and hence $$\\langle f, A(f)\\rangle= t^{-2} \\langle tf, A(tf)\\rangle \\le t^{-2}\\alpha |tf|_2=\\alpha|f|_2.$$ $\\endgroup$ Jochen Wengenroth –  Jochen Wengenroth 2020-08-05 06:17:05 +00:00 Commented Aug 5, 2020 at 6:17 1 $\\begingroup$ Yes, I stated the question wrongly. Just fixed it.
