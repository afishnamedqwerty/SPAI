  "body": "Note: I have modified the initial question as follows: Let $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_d$ be positive weights, and $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_d$ be positive variables. Now, let us consider the following harmonic sum $H$ of the $d$ variables w.r.t. the weights: $H = \\frac{1}{\\frac{w_1}{x_1} + \\frac{w_2}{x_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{w_d}{x_d}}$ . Then, I am wondering if $H$ can be approximately expressed with some arithmetic formalization as follows: $H \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} (\\tau_i(w_1, \\ldots, w_d)\\cdot \\theta_i(x_1, \\ldots, x_d)),$ where each $\\tau_i$ ( resp. $\\theta_i$ ) is any function independent from the variables $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_d$ ( resp. the weights $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_d$ ). The equality would hold when $w_k = x_k$ ( $1\\leq k \\leq d$ ). I could not handle this problem in my knowledge. I should be pleased to have any comments or suggestions (on the mathematical field related to this problem). harmonic-analysis arithmetic-functions Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 10, 2020 at 5:03 asked Jul 8, 2020 at 3:18 Yoshitaka 1 2 2 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ What's wrong with $H\\ge \\frac 1{\\sqrt{ \\sum_i w_i^2}} \\frac 1{\\sqrt {\\sum_i x_i^2}}$? $\\endgroup$ fedja –  fedja 2020-07-10 02:58:53 +00:00 Commented Jul 10, 2020 at 2:58 $\\begingroup$ Thank you very much. That's very helpful for me. And now, I notice that I should have written the equality condition as $w_k = \\frac{1}{x_k}$, not $w_k = x_k$. I am sorry for that. My concern is that though the Schwarz inequality holds, when we consider $w_k = \\frac{1}{x_k}$ as the expected equality condition, $H$ does not reach the right term; $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Sigma_i w_i^2}}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Sigma_i x_i^2}}$. $\\endgroup$ Yoshitaka –  Yoshitaka 2020-07-10 04:18:18 +00:00 Commented Jul 10, 2020 at 4:18 $\\begingroup$ It should be better to modify my question as follows. Suppose that $H$ is written as $\\frac{1}{\\frac{w_1}{x_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{w_d}{x_d}}$. Then, is it possible to express $H$ in an arithmetic form like $H \\geq \\Sigma_i (\\tau_i(w_1, \\ldots, w_d)\\cdot \\theta_i(x_1, \\ldots, x_d))$ with equality $w_k = x_k (1\\leq k \\leq d)$, where $\\tau_i$ (resp. $\\theta_i$) is any function independent from the variables $x_1, \\ldots, x_d$ (resp. the weights $w_1,\\ldots, w_d$)? $\\endgroup$ Yoshitaka –  Yoshitaka 2020-07-10 04:41:19 +00:00 Commented Jul 10, 2020 at 4:41 $\\begingroup$ I am sorry for the inconvenience to change the initial query (whose solution must be collect with yours). I was happy to have your helpful comment on the problem which troubles me. $\\endgroup$ Yoshitaka –  Yoshitaka 2020-07-10 04:41:53 +00:00 Commented Jul 10, 2020 at 4:41 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
