  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - Sifted sets can&#39;t accumulate on a curve",
  "body": "Let $f,g,h$ be elements in $\\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ , each geometrically integral and at least two of them are distinct. Without loss of generality, suppose that $f$ is not proportional to $g$ over $\\mathbb{C}$ , so that the variety $V_{f,g} = \\{f = g = 0\\}$ has co-dimension 2 in $\\mathbb{A}^2$ . Let $T$ be a large real number, and fix a prime $T/\\log T < p < T$ . Define the set $$\\displaystyle S_{f,g}(T) = \\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\cap [-T,T]^2 : \\mathbf{x} \\pmod{\\ell} \\in V_{f,g}(\\mathbb{F}_\\ell) \\text{ for some } T/\\log T < \\ell < T \\},$$ where $\\ell$ runs over primes. One can show that $$\\displaystyle |S_{f,g}(T)| \\asymp T.$$ My question is, is it possible for the intersection of $S_{f,g}(T)$ and the set $$\\displaystyle C_h(p; T) = \\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\cap [-T,T]^2 : h(\\mathbf{x}) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\\}$$ to be large? Indeed, the question is as in the title, can the \"sifted set\" $S_{f,g}(T)$ have large intersection with a curve modulo a fixed prime $p$ ? ag.algebraic-geometry nt.number-theory arithmetic-geometry Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 13, 2020 at 12:05 asked Jul 13, 2020 at 11:28 Stanley Yao Xiao ♦ 31k 7 7 gold badges 63 63 silver badges 173 173 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
