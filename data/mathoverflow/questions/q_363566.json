  "body": "I have two cones $A$ and $B$ in a Euclidean space. I want to show that $\\mathrm{Conv}\\,A=\\mathrm{Dual}\\,B$ ; that is, $a\\in\\mathrm{Conv}\\,A$ if and only if $\\langle a,b\\rangle\\ge 0$ for any $b\\in B$ . The inclusion $\\mathrm{Conv}\\,A\\subset \\mathrm{Dual}\\, B$ (or equivalently $\\mathrm{Dual}\\,A\\supset \\mathrm{Conv}\\,B$ ) is easy --- one has to check $\\langle a,b\\rangle\\ge 0$ for pairs $a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$ . It remains to show the opposite inclusion $\\mathrm{Conv}\\,A\\supset \\mathrm{Dual}\\,B$ . I see that in principle it can be done by calculations. Do you know tricks that help to prove the opposite inclusion $\\mathrm{Conv}\\,A\\supset \\mathrm{Dual}\\,B$ ? Is there software that can help? The cones $A$ and $B$ are very concrete; they are given by few algebraic identities and inequalities in $\\mathbb R^{10}$ . (In principle I could describe the sets of vectors here, but I do not think it might help.) mg.metric-geometry convex-geometry convex-optimization convex-analysis Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jun 19, 2020 at 19:30 Anton Petrunin 47.1k 17 17 gold badges 148 148 silver badges 315 315 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 1 $\\begingroup$ I assume that $\\operatorname{Conv} A$ denotes the convex hull of $A$? But why do you need to take the convex hull of a cone, given that a cone is already convex? $\\endgroup$ Jochen Glueck –  Jochen Glueck 2020-06-19 21:27:10 +00:00 Commented Jun 19, 2020 at 21:27 1 $\\begingroup$ @JochenGlueck I did not say that cones are convex (in fact they are not). $\\endgroup$ Anton Petrunin –  Anton Petrunin 2020-06-20 03:51:01 +00:00 Commented Jun 20, 2020 at 3:51 $\\begingroup$ Thank you very much for your response! Hmm, may I suggest to include a definition of your usage of the word cone in the question? (I just browsed half a dozen books about ordered vector spaces; many of them define a cone indeed to be always convex, while some others do not - and there also seem to be some further differences between the various definitions of a cone in the literature). $\\endgroup$ Jochen Glueck –  Jochen Glueck 2020-06-20 12:49:59 +00:00 Commented Jun 20, 2020 at 12:49 $\\begingroup$ @JochenGlueck a set $X$ is a cone if $v\\in X$ implies that $\\lambda{\\cdot}v\\in X$ for any $\\lambda\\ge0$. $\\endgroup$ Anton Petrunin –  Anton Petrunin 2020-06-20 19:08:33 +00:00 Commented Jun 20, 2020 at 19:08 $\\begingroup$ Thank you very much. $\\endgroup$ Jochen Glueck –  Jochen Glueck 2020-06-20 20:04:57 +00:00 Commented Jun 20, 2020 at 20:04 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
