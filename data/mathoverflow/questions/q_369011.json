  "body": "I posted this question on MSE and I would like to see if my reasoning is correct. Let $M^3$ be a compact, connected and oriented $3$ -manifold with nonempty boundary and let $\\Sigma^2$ be a compact and embedded surface such that $\\Sigma \\cap \\partial M = \\partial \\Sigma$ . If $\\Sigma$ determines a nonzero class in $H_2(M, \\partial M;\\mathbb{Z})$ , does it follow that $\\Sigma$ is orientable? Here is what I thought. Let $\\phi : (\\Sigma, \\partial \\Sigma) \\to (M, \\partial M)$ be the embedding of $\\Sigma$ into $M$ . This induces a map $$\\phi_* : H_2(\\Sigma, \\partial \\Sigma; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_2(M, \\partial M; \\mathbb{Z})$$ in homology. Since $\\Sigma$ determines a nonzero class in $H_2(M, \\partial M; \\mathbb{Z})$ , this implies that there exists a nonzero class $\\alpha \\in H_2(\\Sigma, \\partial \\Sigma; \\mathbb{Z})$ such that $\\phi_*(\\alpha) \\neq 0$ . In particular, $H_2(\\Sigma, \\partial \\Sigma; \\mathbb{Z}) \\neq 0$ , which means precisely that $\\Sigma$ is orientable. at.algebraic-topology smooth-manifolds homology orientation Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Aug 12, 2020 at 23:37 Eduardo Longa 2,127 13 13 silver badges 12 12 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 11 $\\begingroup$ $\\Sigma$ does not determine a class at all (zero or otherwise) unless it's oriented; it doesn't have a fundamental class to push forward! $\\endgroup$ mme –  mme 2020-08-13 00:44:25 +00:00 Commented Aug 13, 2020 at 0:44 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
