  "body": "Let $\\{ P_i \\}$ be the set of all minimal prime ideals of a commutative ring $R $ . Is there any conditions on $R $ under which there exists an element $x\\in R $ such that $P_i $ is an ideal of $R $ maximal with respect to not containing $x $ for each $i $ ? ag.algebraic-geometry ac.commutative-algebra sheaf-theory zariski-topology Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 20, 2020 at 13:27 RobPratt 5,784 1 1 gold badge 16 16 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges asked Jun 20, 2020 at 12:42 AzadehEil 11 1 1 bronze badge $\\endgroup$ 1 1 $\\begingroup$ If $A$ is a domain and the intersection of nonzero ideals of $A$ is nonzero, then $A$ is a field. Indeed, if $y$ is nonzero in this intersection, $y\\in y^2A$, say $y=y^2a$, so $1=ya$ using that $A$ is a domain, and hence $y$ is invertible, and hence this intersection is $A$, so $A$ is a field. Apply this to $R/P_i$ to deduce that each $P_i$ is maximal. Conversely if each $P_i$ is maximal, then $x=1$ works. So this holds iff $A$ has Krull dimension $0$. $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-06-20 13:00:33 +00:00 Commented Jun 20, 2020 at 13:00 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
