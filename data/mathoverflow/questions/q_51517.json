  "body": "Let $R,S,T$ be (associative, with a 1) rings, and $m,n,r,s$ be non-negative integers. If (a) $R$ is isomorphic to $M_{m\\times m}(T)$ and $S$ is isomorphic to $M_{n\\times n}(T)$ and $m\\cdot r = n\\cdot s$ or (b) $R$ and $S$ both have exactly one element then $M_{r\\times r}(R)$ is isomorphic to $M_{s\\times s}(S)$. Based on the last comment on Tom Goodwillie's answer to my earlier question , (a) and (b) apparently do not exhaust the cases in which $M_{r\\times r}(R)$ is isomorphic to $M_{s\\times s}(S)$. What are examples to show that? Can they be finite? Is there a relatively simple exhaustion of when $M_{r\\times r}(R)$ is isomorphic to $M_{s\\times s}(S)$ in terms of $R,S,r,s$? What if $R$ and $S$ are assumed to be finite? ra.rings-and-algebras matrices Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Apr 13, 2017 at 12:58 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Jan 9, 2011 at 3:26 user5810 $\\endgroup$ 3 1 $\\begingroup$ You can take $R$ to be the column finite, row finite matrices. Then all of its matrix rings are isomorphic to it. $\\endgroup$ Mariano Suárez-Álvarez –  Mariano Suárez-Álvarez 2011-01-09 04:03:04 +00:00 Commented Jan 9, 2011 at 4:03 1 $\\begingroup$ Off-topic, but since your profile has no contact details: you may or may not want to respond to remarks following your comment at mathoverflow.net/questions/52032 $\\endgroup$ Yemon Choi –  Yemon Choi 2011-01-16 04:24:06 +00:00 Commented Jan 16, 2011 at 4:24 $\\begingroup$ Thanks, I just did.
