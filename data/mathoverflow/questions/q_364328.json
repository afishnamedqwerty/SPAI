  "title": "ct.category theory - Braided category inside braided 2-category",
  "body": "Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a semistrict braided monoidal $2$ -category in the sense of [BN] (so in particular a strict $2$ -category). Let $\\mathcal{C}_1$ be the category of $1$ -morphisms (objects) and $2$ -morphisms (morphisms) in $\\mathcal{C}$ . (I hope that this is allowed. I think of $\\mathcal{C}_1$ as a coproduct of all the Hom-categories in $\\mathcal{C}$ ) The semistrict monoidal structure ( $\\boxtimes$ ) on $\\mathcal{C}$ induces a monoidal structure ( $\\otimes$ ) on $\\mathcal{C}_1$ . Let $R: \\boxtimes \\Rightarrow \\boxtimes^{op}$ be the pseudo-natural equivalence corresponding to the braiding in $\\mathcal{C}$ . For $1$ -morphisms $f:a \\to c$ and $g:b \\to d$ we can define $f\\widehat{\\otimes}g:=R_{c,d}\\circ (f \\otimes g)$ and $g\\check{\\otimes}f:=(g\\otimes f)\\circ R_{a,b}$ (analogously on morphisms in $\\mathcal{C}_1$ ). By pseudo-naturality of $R$ we have a natural transformation $c:\\widehat{\\otimes} \\to \\check{\\otimes}^{op}$ in $\\mathcal{C}_1$ satisfying the hexagon equations of a braiding. So $\\mathcal{C}_1$ looks very similar to a braided monoidal category, with \"the only difference\" that $\\widehat{\\otimes} \\neq \\check{\\otimes}$ . Now, assume that $\\mathcal{C}$ had enough structure, so that $\\mathcal{C}_1$ is an abelian category. Is there a way of \"modding out\" the difference of $\\widehat{\\otimes}$ and $\\check{\\otimes}$ in $\\mathcal{C}_1$ ? Maybe by considering some kind of coequalizer? If so, what are the conditions on $c$ for being well-defined on the new category?
