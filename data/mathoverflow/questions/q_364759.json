  "title": "rt.representation theory - Let $T$ be a maximal torus of $SU(k+1)$. Who is the normalizer $N(T)$ of $T$ in $O(2k+2)$?",
  "body": "I'm reading an article which I cannot understand a paragraph very well. $T$ is a maximal torus of $SU(k+1)$ acting linearly on $\\mathbb{C}^{k+1}$ . And here is what is written that I cannot fully understand: Note that the normalizer $N=N(T)$ of $T$ in $O(2k+2)$ normalizes the centralizer $C(T)$ of $T$ in $O(2k+2)$ . Assume $k\\geq 2$ . Since $C(T)$ is a maximal torus of $U(k+1)$ which is also a maximal torus of $O(2k+2)$ , we see that $C(T)$ is the identity component of the normalizer $N$ . Moreover, $N$ is generated by $C(T)$ , the complex conjugation $c$ and the symmetric group $S_{k+1}$ of permutations of complex coordinates. First of all, I cannot see why $C(T)$ should be a maximal torus of $U(k+1)$ . I can see why it should be connect, since it is the union of maximal tori in $U(k+1)$ containing $T$ . My supervisor also said that it is because a element in $C(T)$ lies on $N(T)$ , and we can assume, using complex conjugation $c$ , that every element $n\\in N(T)$ is complex-linear on $\\mathbb{C}^{k+1}$ (and I cannot see why). And that, up to permutation, $n$ preserves the decomposition $\\mathbb{C}^{k+1}=\\mathbb{C}\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus \\mathbb{C}$ (which I also cannot see why). And furhter he said that such an element must Lie on the maximal torus $S^1\\times\\cdots\\times S^1\\subset U(K+1)$ ; factorization compatible with the decomposition $\\mathbb{C}^{k+1}=\\mathbb{C}\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus \\mathbb{C}$ (and, again, I cannot see why). Given this, why should $C(T)$ be the indentity component of $N(T)$ ? rt.representation-theory lie-groups Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 3, 2020 at 17:07 Gomes93 191 1 1 silver badge 9 9 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 1 $\\begingroup$ Why don't you calculate? Take $k=2$. Take the diagonal maximal torus in ${\\rm SU}(3)$; it is 2-dimensional. Compute its centralizer in $U(3)$; it is the 3-dimensional diagonal torus. Clearly this 3-dimensional torus is a maximal torus in $U(3)$ and a maximal torus in ${\\rm SO}(6)$. You continue calculations.... $\\endgroup$ Mikhail Borovoi –  Mikhail Borovoi 2020-07-05 10:36:37 +00:00 Commented Jul 5, 2020 at 10:36 $\\begingroup$ I have calculated it to the usual torus in SU(n), but I would like to understant it more geometrically/generally, for an arbitrary maximal torus of $SU(n)$. I know that all need can be stracted from those calculations, but I would like to understand the techinics used by the author, which are much more general. $\\endgroup$ Gomes93 –  Gomes93 2020-07-05 19:44:32 +00:00 Commented Jul 5, 2020 at 19:44 3 $\\begingroup$ It is the same! You take an arbitrary maximal torus $T\\subset {\\rm SU}(n)$, you consider its natural complex representation in $V:={\\Bbb C}^n$, this representation uniquely decomposes in a direct sum of one-dimensional complex representations, you take eigenvectors as basis vectors, and you get the \"usual\" diagonal torus. Then you should calculate! $\\endgroup$ Mikhail Borovoi –  Mikhail Borovoi 2020-07-06 08:32:01 +00:00 Commented Jul 6, 2020 at 8:32 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
