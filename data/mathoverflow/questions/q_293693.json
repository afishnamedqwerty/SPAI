  "body": "Note: In this question by $\\mathbb{C}P^1 \\subset \\mathbb{C}P^2$ we mean that we choose the line at infinity in the form $\\{[0,y,z]\\in \\mathbb{C}P^2\\} $ which is identified by $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ . Assume that $\\{p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k\\}$ are $k$ points on $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ . Let $\\chi:\\pi_1(\\mathbb{C}P^1\\setminus \\{p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k\\})\\to \\mathbb{C} \\setminus\\{0\\}$ be a group homomorphism. Is there a singular holomorphic foliation by curve, briefly SHFC, of $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ such that $\\mathbb{C}P^1 \\subset \\mathbb{C}P^2$ would be a leaf having $\\{p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k\\}$ as singularities and the linearized monodoromy representation of $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ coincide $\\chi$ ? If the answer is no, for what kind of representation $\\chi$ , the answer would be affirmative? By linearized monodoromy representation we mean the following: We fix a base point $p$ on the leaf at infinity $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ which is not a singular point. We fix a $1$ -dimensional local transversal $s$ passing $p$ . For every loop $\\gamma$ based on $p$ and contained in $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ , we have a holonomy map $h_{\\gamma}$ defined on $s$ . Then $h_{\\gamma}'(p)$ is a non zero complex number which is independent of homotopy class of $\\gamma$ and is independent of choosing transversal $s$ . So the linearized monodoromy representation $\\chi$ mentioned in the question is defined as $\\chi(\\gamma)=h_{\\gamma}'(p)$ . complex-geometry ds.dynamical-systems differential-equations foliations Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Feb 23, 2018 at 14:24 Ali Taghavi 1 $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
