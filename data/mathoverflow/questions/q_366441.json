  "title": "fa.functional analysis - If $f:U_1\\to\\mathcal L^p(\\mu;E_2)$ is Fr&#233;chet differentiable, can we say anything about the Fr&#233;chet differentiability of $u\\mapsto f(u)(\\omega)$?",
  "body": "Let $(\\Omega,\\mathcal A,\\mu)$ be a $\\sigma$ -finite measure space, $p\\ge1$ , $E_i$ be a $\\mathbb R$ -Banach space, $U_1\\subseteq E_1$ be open and $f:U_1\\to L$ be Fréchet differentiable at $x\\in U_1$ , where $L=\\mathcal L^p(\\mu;E)$ or $L=L^p(\\mu;E)$ . For a function $f$ of this form, can we say anything about the Fréchet differentiability of $$U_1\\to E_2\\;,\\;\\;\\;u\\mapsto f(u)(\\omega)\\tag1$$ for $\\omega\\in\\Omega$ (outside a $\\mu$ -null set)? Strictly speaking, the notion of Fréchet differentiability is not defined for $L=\\mathcal L^p(\\mu;E_2)$ , since $\\mathcal L^p(\\mu;E_2)$ is only a semi-normed space and hence limits are not unique (only up to a $\\mu$ -null set). However, the assumption could be understood in the sense that the convergence in the definition of Fréchet differentiability holds. On the other hand, if $L=L^p(\\mu;E)$ , we've got the problem that the elements of $L^p(\\mu;E_2)$ are only equivalence classes and hence the expression $g(\\omega)$ is not well-defined for $g\\in L^p(\\mu;E_2)$ , unless we pick a particular representative. Maybe we need the existence of continuous representatives. So, maybe the desired conclusion is possible if $L^p(\\mu;E)$ is replaced by a suitable closed subspace (such as a Sobolev space). fa.functional-analysis measure-theory sobolev-spaces Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 24, 2020 at 18:35 asked Jul 24, 2020 at 9:46 0xbadf00d 249 1 1 gold badge 6 6 silver badges 17 17 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ There are two dollar sign missing in the text below formula (1). $\\endgroup$ Daniele Tampieri –  Daniele Tampieri 2020-07-24 11:03:02 +00:00 Commented Jul 24, 2020 at 11:03 $\\begingroup$ @DanieleTampieri Thanks for noting.

FWIW, one situation where I think the implication holds, is when $\\Omega$ has a nice topology, $E_1 = \\mathbb C$, $f$ is jointly continuous and $L^p$-holomorphic. When you then write $f(u, \\omega) - f(0, \\omega) = u f'(0, \\omega) + u R(u, \\omega)$; you can use Cauchy's integral formula to prove that $f'$ and $R$ are jointly continuous, and then $R \\to 0$ in $L^p$ implies $R \\to 0$ everywhere; i.e. $f$ is pointwise holomorphic (=for fixed $\\omega$). $\\endgroup$ Bart Michels –  Bart Michels 2020-07-26 11:53:24 +00:00 Commented Jul 26, 2020 at 11:53 $\\begingroup$ @BartMichels Convergence in $L^1$ at least implies convergence in measure and hence convergence almost everywhere along a subsequence. $\\endgroup$ 0xbadf00d –  0xbadf00d 2020-07-26 13:57:48 +00:00 Commented Jul 26, 2020 at 13:57 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
