  "title": "real analysis - Have you seen this PDE before?",
  "body": "Consider the second-order nonlinear PDE $$(\\partial_x\\partial_y\\varphi)\\cdot\\varphi = \\partial_x\\varphi\\,\\partial_y\\varphi.$$ This PDE is solved by all ('separable') functions $\\varphi\\in C^2(\\Omega)$ of the form $\\varphi(x,y) = \\ell(x)\\cdot r(y)$ (any $\\Omega\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2$ open). I'd like to know whether each (classical) solution of the PDE is of this form. Are you aware of any 'uniqueness' results for the above PDE which might (dis)prove this? real-analysis ap.analysis-of-pdes mp.mathematical-physics calculus-of-variations Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 15, 2020 at 17:01 Overflowian 2,582 1 1 gold badge 13 13 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges asked Jul 15, 2020 at 9:53 fsp-b 453 2 2 silver badges 8 8 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 11 $\\begingroup$ This equation is equivalent to $\\partial_x \\partial_y \\log(\\varphi) = 0$.
