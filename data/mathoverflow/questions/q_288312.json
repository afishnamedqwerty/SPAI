  "body": "Let $f_k$ be a sequence of rational functions analytic in the discs $\\{ |z| < 1 + \\epsilon_k\\}$ (with some $\\epsilon_k > 0$), which converge to an analytic function $f$ in every point $|z| < 1$ (the convergence is uniform on compact subsets of $\\mathbb{E}$). Furthermore, we assume that in $z=1$ every derivative $f^{(n)}_k(1)$ converges to some $a(n)$ as $k$ goes to $\\infty$ and that $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a(n)(z-1)^n$ converges in some disc $\\{ |z - 1| < \\delta\\}$. My question is: does $f$ already have an analytic continuation around $z=1$ with the above taylor expansion? It seems to be difficult here that we do not know whether the convergence of the $f^{(n)}_k(1)$ is uniform in a certain sense. Remark: A positive answer not using that $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a(n)(z-1)^n$ is locally analytic would be very gratifying in my case. cv.complex-variables analytic-functions Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Mar 26, 2019 at 15:49 YCor 67.5k 5 5 gold badges 203 203 silver badges 301 301 bronze badges asked Dec 12, 2017 at 9:53 Johann Franke 163 5 5 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 1 $\\begingroup$ Take $h(z) = e^{1/z},f_k(z) = h(z-1-\\frac{1}{ k})$ then $\\forall n,\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} f_k^{(n)}(1) = 0$. $\\endgroup$ reuns –  reuns 2017-12-12 11:06:45 +00:00 Commented Dec 12, 2017 at 11:06 $\\begingroup$ Thanks, got the same counter-example meanwhile... Fortunately I can exclude any essential singularities in my case: I know that the $f_k$ are (without loss of generality) rational functions, in particular meromorphic in the entire plane. $\\endgroup$ Johann Franke –  Johann Franke 2017-12-12 11:30:46 +00:00 Commented Dec 12, 2017 at 11:30 1 $\\begingroup$ $f_k(z ) = \\sum_{m=0}^{e^{e^k}} \\frac{1}{m!} (\\frac{1}{z-1-1/k})^m$ $\\endgroup$ reuns –  reuns 2017-12-12 12:01:44 +00:00 Commented Dec 12, 2017 at 12:01 1 $\\begingroup$ Given that the Runge theorem allows you to approximate anything analytic in $\\{|z|<1-3\\delta\\}\\cup\\{|z-1|<2\\delta\\}$ uniformly by polynomials on $\\{|z|\\le 1-4\\delta\\}\\cup\\{|z-1|\\le \\delta\\}$ with any precision you want, asking the question in this form is a rather poor idea.
