  "body": "Is it true that for any positive integer $m$ there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $\\gcd(\\lfloor n\\sqrt{2}\\rfloor, \\lfloor n\\sqrt{3}\\rfloor)=m$ ? $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the floor function of $x$ and $\\gcd$ is the greatest common divisor. In fact we can prove that this result is true for $\\gcd(\\lfloor n\\sqrt{2}\\rfloor, n)=m$ (consider a solution $(x_k,y_k)$ to the Pell equation $x^2-2y^2=-1$ , such that $x_k>m$ and take $n=my_k$ ). Does this result hold if instead of $\\sqrt{3}$ we have $\\sqrt{k}$ , where $k$ is not a perfect square, $k>2$ ? Can this result be generalized in any way? If $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers such that $\\gcd(\\lfloor na \\rfloor$ , $\\lfloor nb \\rfloor)=m$ holds for infinitely many positive integers $n$ for each $m$ , what can be said about $a$ and $b$ ? nt.number-theory pr.probability Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 1, 2020 at 6:12 asked Jun 28, 2020 at 9:26 jack 3,143 16 16 silver badges 26 26 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 2 $\\begingroup$ By the multidimensional equidistribution theorem , for any $m$, the probability of $m$ dividing both $\\lfloor{n\\sqrt 2}\\rfloor$ and $\\lfloor{n\\sqrt 3}\\rfloor$ is $1/m^2$. $gcd(\\lfloor{n\\sqrt 2}\\rfloor, \\lfloor{n\\sqrt 3}\\rfloor)=m$ is equivalent to $m$ dividing both $\\lfloor{n\\sqrt 2}\\rfloor$ and $\\lfloor{n\\sqrt 3}\\rfloor$, but neither of $2m,3m,5m,7m,11m,...$ divides both $\\lfloor{n\\sqrt 2}\\rfloor$ and $\\lfloor{n\\sqrt 3}\\rfloor$. (One should use an effective estimate here, in order to deal with infinite number of primes.) $\\endgroup$ LeechLattice –  LeechLattice 2020-06-28 10:07:28 +00:00 Commented Jun 28, 2020 at 10:07 $\\begingroup$ The answers to your last two questions are both \"no\". The correct generalization is requiring $a,b$ nonzero and $a/b$ irrational. If $a/b$ is rational, let $a/b=p/q$ ($p,q\\in \\mathbb Z$), and $q\\lfloor na \\rfloor-p \\lfloor nb \\rfloor$ is bounded independent of $n$, so $\\gcd(\\lfloor na \\rfloor,\\lfloor nb \\rfloor)$ is either bounded or of the order of $n$. If $a/b$ is irrational, the equidistribution theorem works (use one-dimensional equidistribution if only one of $a$ and $b$ is irrational). $\\endgroup$ LeechLattice –  LeechLattice 2020-06-28 12:02:07 +00:00 Commented Jun 28, 2020 at 12:02 $\\begingroup$ @LeechLattice Thanks, I edited the question. $\\endgroup$ jack –  jack 2020-07-01 06:14:40 +00:00 Commented Jul 1, 2020 at 6:14 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
