  "title": "ca.classical analysis and odes - Integrability of Fourier transform of truncated fractional power",
  "body": "Is the Fourier transform of the function $f$ which agrees with $1_{[-1.1]}|x|^\\alpha$ on $[-1,1]$ and then decays very fast to zero to become a compactly supported continuous function, is in $L^1(\\mathbb R)$ , where $\\alpha\\in(1,2)$ ? My guess is that the answer is true. If I can show that the identity $\\widehat{D^\\alpha f}(\\zeta)=(2\\pi i\\zeta)^\\alpha\\hat{f}(\\zeta)$ holds in some sense and we have $D^\\alpha(1_{[-1,1]}|x|^\\alpha)=\\alpha!|x|1_{[-1,1]}$ in some sense. Then $\\hat{f}$ would have enough decay at infinity to make it in $L^1(\\mathbb R)?$ May be fractional derivatives and their interaction with the Fourier transform might be helpful. But I could not find any good reference (easily readable) which can make the above argument rigorous? For my purpose if one such $f$ exists for which the Fourier transform is integrable is enough? ca.classical-analysis-and-odes fourier-analysis fourier-transform Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 27, 2020 at 19:25 asked Jun 27, 2020 at 18:48 A beginner mathmatician 1,980 7 7 silver badges 13 13 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 1 $\\begingroup$ If $\\hat{f}\\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$ then $f\\in C(\\mathbb{R})$ so the answer is no.

Ok. I missed that observation. Clearly, for $|x|$ we have decay $|\\zeta|^{-2}$ at $\\infty.$ But how to prove your statement rigorously? $\\endgroup$ A beginner mathmatician –  A beginner mathmatician 2020-06-28 03:42:17 +00:00 Commented Jun 28, 2020 at 3:42 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
