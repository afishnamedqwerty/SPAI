  "body": "Consider a filtered probability space $(\\Omega, (\\mathcal F_n), \\mathcal F, \\mathbb P)$, where $\\Omega$ is the set of sequences with value in some $E \\subseteq \\mathbb R^d$, and $\\mathcal F$ is the canonical filtration generated by the coordinate maps $(X_n: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb R^d)$. We will assume that $X$ is a martingale. Given a non-negative martingale $M$ with expectation $1$, there exists a probability measure $\\mathbb Q$ on $(\\Omega, \\mathcal F)$ such that: $$M_n = \\left.\\frac {\\mathrm d \\mathbb Q}{\\mathrm d \\mathbb P}\\right|_{\\mathcal F_n}.$$ This is a consequence of Kolmogorov's extension theorem. Conversely, for any $\\mathbb Q \\ll \\mathbb P $, the expression above defines a martingale in the original probability space. Now, let's look at martingale transforms. All martingale transforms of $X$ are martingales, but apart from the very specific case of the binomial model, the converse is false. First question : is there a characterization of the measures $\\mathbb Q \\ll \\mathbb P$ for which $\\left(\\left.\\frac {\\mathrm d \\mathbb Q}{\\mathrm d \\mathbb P}\\right|_{\\mathcal F_n}\\right)$ is a martingale transform of $X$? Another interesting property of these Radon Nikodym representations is that, given some non-negative martingale tranform $(X \\cdot H)$ with expectation $1$, the associated probability measure $\\mathbb Q$ satifies: $$\\mathbb E^{\\mathbb Q} (\\log (X \\cdot H)) \\ge \\mathbb E^{\\mathbb Q} (\\log (X \\cdot K)),$$ for all processes $K$ for which $(X \\cdot K)$ is non-negative with expectation $1$. The proof is easy, just write both martingale transforms as Radon Nikodym derivatives and apply Jensen's inequality. Second question : suppose I take $\\mathbb Q \\ll \\mathbb P $. Consider the process $H$ that maximizes $\\mathbb E^{\\mathbb Q} (\\log (X \\cdot H))$. Are there known bounds linking $\\left(\\left.\\frac {\\mathrm d \\mathbb Q}{\\mathrm d \\mathbb P}\\right|_{\\mathcal F_n}\\right)$ and $(X \\cdot H)_n$? reference-request pr.probability stochastic-processes martingales Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Mar 8, 2019 at 21:10 YCor 67.5k 5 5 gold badges 203 203 silver badges 301 301 bronze badges asked Nov 9, 2017 at 17:16 Tartrate 361 1 1 silver badge 8 8 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ 1. Under mild conditions on $E$, the Kolmogorov extension theorem does grant the existence of a unique $\\Bbb Q$ on $\\mathcal F$ such that $d\\Bbb Q|_{\\mathcal F_n}/d\\Bbb P|_{\\mathcal F_n}=M_n$, $\\Bbb P$-a.s., for each $n$. The probability measure $\\Bbb Q$ need not be absolutely continuous with respect to $\\Bbb P$ on $\\mathcal F$, and indeed it may be that $\\Bbb Q\\perp\\Bbb P$. 2. ``All martingale transforms of $X$ are martingales\": You seem to be implicitly assuming that $X$ is a martingale. $\\endgroup$ John Dawkins –  John Dawkins 2017-11-10 16:26:21 +00:00 Commented Nov 10, 2017 at 16:26 $\\begingroup$ Thank you for your comments! Indeed, my statement was inexact. I corrected the question and added the assumption that X is a martingale. $\\endgroup$ Tartrate –  Tartrate 2017-11-10 21:00:05 +00:00 Commented Nov 10, 2017 at 21:00 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
