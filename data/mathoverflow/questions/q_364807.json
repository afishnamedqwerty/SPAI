  "body": "A major open problem in submanifold geometry is to determine whether there exists a nontotally geodesic isometric immersion of $\\mathbb{S}^n$ into $\\mathbb{S}^{2n}$ . Every isometric immersion of $\\mathbb{S}^n$ into $\\mathbb{S}^{n+p}$ is totally geodesic if $p<n$ , and nontotally geodesic examples are known for $p>n$ and also for $p=n=2$ . Case $p=n\\geq3$ remains open. It can be shown that the existence of a nontotally geodesic isometric immersion of $\\mathbb{S}^n$ into $\\mathbb{S}^m$ is equivalent to the existence of a nonconstant solution $Q:\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\setminus\\{0\\}\\to O\\left(n+1,m+1\\right)$ to the linear first-order PDE system $$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x_i}x=0,\\ 1\\leq i\\leq n+1,$$ where $O\\left(n+1,m+1\\right)=\\left\\{Q\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\left(m+1\\right)\\times\\left(n+1\\right)}:Q^TQ=I\\right\\}$ . What parametric representation for $O\\left(n+1,m+1\\right)$ might be useful to addressing this problem? dg.differential-geometry ap.analysis-of-pdes linear-pde Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 4, 2020 at 6:20 asked Jul 4, 2020 at 6:00 SubGeo 89 6 6 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
