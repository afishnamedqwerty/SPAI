  "body": "Let $G_1,G_2$ be $p$ -adic groups. Let $\\rho_1,\\pi_1$ be smooth representations of $G_1$ and $\\rho_2,\\pi_2$ be smooth representations of $G_2$ . Assume that $\\pi_2$ is admissible. I am wondering that if $\\text{Hom}_{G_1}(\\rho_1,\\pi_1)=0$ , then $\\text{Hom}_{G_1 \\times G_2}(\\rho_1 \\boxtimes \\rho_2,\\pi_1 \\boxtimes \\pi_2 )=0$ ? If it does not true in general, then is it true when $\\pi_1$ is 1-dimensional representation? rt.representation-theory p-adic-groups Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 6, 2020 at 5:41 asked Jul 4, 2020 at 8:16 Monty 1,759 9 9 silver badges 9 9 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 9 $\\begingroup$ Maybe I am being very stupid here: under the assumption, wouldn't $\\mathrm{Hom}_{G_1}(\\rho_1\\otimes V_1,\\pi_1\\otimes V_2)=0$ for any vector spaces $V_1,V_2$ (in particular possibly infinite-dimensional) as the image of $v\\otimes w$ is necessarily zero for any $v\\in\\rho_1$, $w\\in V_1$, without even using the smoothness? $\\endgroup$ Cheng-Chiang Tsai –  Cheng-Chiang Tsai 2020-07-05 01:13:41 +00:00 Commented Jul 5, 2020 at 1:13 $\\begingroup$ @Cheng, Thank you for your comment. Why do u think the image of $v \\otimes w$ is necessarily zero? $\\endgroup$ Monty –  Monty 2020-07-06 05:41:20 +00:00 Commented Jul 6, 2020 at 5:41 1 $\\begingroup$ $\\DeclareMathOperator\\Hom{Hom}$Assuming, as your title suggests, $\\boxtimes$ stands for the external tensor product: Pick two different 1D representations $\\rho_1$ and $\\pi_1$ of $G$. Then $\\Hom_{G_1}(\\rho_1, \\pi_1)$ is $0$ but $\\Hom_{G_1 \\times G_1}(\\rho_1 \\boxtimes \\pi_1, \\pi_1 \\boxtimes \\rho_1)$ is non-$0$. $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-07-06 06:17:29 +00:00 Commented Jul 6, 2020 at 6:17 1 $\\begingroup$ @LSpice I believe the map you suggest is only $G_1$-equivariant (diagonally), not $G_1\\times G_1$-equivariant: one way goes $(x,y)\\mapsto(gx,g'y)\\mapsto(g'y,gx)$ and another $(x,y)\\mapsto(y,x)\\mapsto(gy,g'x)$. Or do you have in mind some other map? $\\endgroup$ მამუკა ჯიბლაძე –  მამუკა ჯიბლაძე 2020-07-06 06:56:49 +00:00 Commented Jul 6, 2020 at 6:56 1 $\\begingroup$ Following my original comment, suppose $\\varphi\\in\\mathrm{Hom}_{G_1}(\\rho_1\\otimes V_1,\\pi_1\\otimes V_2)$ is such that $\\varphi(v\\otimes w)\\in\\pi_1\\otimes V_2$ is non-zero. We can always pick a functional $\\phi$ on $V_2$ such that $\\phi(\\varphi(v\\otimes w))\\not=0$. But then $\\phi\\circ\\varphi|_{\\rho_1\\otimes\\langle w\\rangle}\\in\\mathrm{Hom}_{G_1}(\\rho_1,\\pi_1)\\not=0$. Or is it? $\\endgroup$ Cheng-Chiang Tsai –  Cheng-Chiang Tsai 2020-07-07 06:41:34 +00:00 Commented Jul 7, 2020 at 6:41  |  Show 4 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
