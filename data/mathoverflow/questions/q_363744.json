  "body": "Browsing through my notes on Artin rings, I have realized that I don't know an example for this and I wasn't able to google anything relevant. What is an example for a commutative non-Noetherian local ring $(R,\\mathfrak{m})$ with nilpotent maximal ideal, i.e. $\\mathfrak{m}^n = 0$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ ? Note that in this setting $R$ Noetherian $\\Leftrightarrow$ $R$ Artinian. In this line of thoughts: Is there a standard name for local rings with a nilpotent maximal ideal? ac.commutative-algebra Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jun 21, 2020 at 19:27 M.G. 7,933 3 3 gold badges 49 49 silver badges 64 64 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 2 $\\begingroup$ Take $R = k[x_1,\\ldots]$ with $\\mathfrak m = (x_1,\\ldots)$ and look at $R/\\mathfrak m^2$. (However, this does not work for any maximal ideal that is not finitely generated, because it is possible that $\\mathfrak m = \\mathfrak m^2$, in which case $R/\\mathfrak m^2 = R/\\mathfrak m$ is a field. An example of such an $\\mathfrak m$ is the maximal ideal in a valuation ring with divisible value group.) $\\endgroup$ R. van Dobben de Bruyn –  R. van Dobben de Bruyn 2020-06-21 19:43:02 +00:00 Commented Jun 21, 2020 at 19:43 2 $\\begingroup$ In fact in the case $\\mathfrak m^2 = 0$ where $R$ contains $k = R/\\mathfrak m$, we must have $$R = k \\oplus M = \\operatorname{Sym}^*(M)/\\operatorname{Sym}^{\\geq 2}(M)$$ for some $k$-module $M$. This is an example of the type you're looking for if and only if $M$ is not finitely generated. $\\endgroup$ R. van Dobben de Bruyn –  R. van Dobben de Bruyn 2020-06-21 19:49:49 +00:00 Commented Jun 21, 2020 at 19:49 $\\begingroup$ @R.vanDobbendeBruyn: thanks for making it obvious what to look at!
