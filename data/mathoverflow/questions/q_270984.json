  "body": "Assume that $E$ is a Riemannian vector bundle, then its structure group is reduced to $O(n)$ . Then the structure group of $E \\oplus E$ is reduced to $D(O(n) \\oplus O(n)) \\subset Sp(2n)$ where $$D(O(n) \\oplus O(n))=\\{ A\\oplus A\\mid A \\in O(n)\\}$$ So there is a natural symplectic structure $\\omega $ on each fiber of $E \\oplus E$ .(We use a maximal atlas of trivialization charts for $E \\oplus E$ whose structure group is contained in $D(O(n) \\oplus O(n))$ . let $T:E \\to E \\oplus E$ be an arbitrary morphism. We pull back $\\omega $ to $T^*(\\omega)$ . So $T^*(\\omega)$ is a $2$ - form on each fiber of $E$ . The above construction can be applied to $E=TM$ where $M$ is a compact Riemannian $2$ dimensional manifold. Associated with a compact Riemannian surface $(M,g)$ , we define a a quantity $q(M,g)$ as follows: $$q(M,g) =\\sup_T |\\int_M T^*(\\omega)|$$ where $T$ varies on all isometric embedding of $TM$ into $TM \\oplus TM$ where the latter is equipped with the product metric. Is this quantity finite? Is it independent of choosing a maximal trivialization atlas for $TM \\oplus TM$ whose transition maps are contained in $D(O(n) \\oplus O(n))$ ? If the answer of the above question is \"yes\", what would be an interpretation of this quantity $q(M,g)$ ? Note that the same construction can be repeated for an arbitrary compact $2k$ dimensional manifold by integration of ${(T^*(\\omega))}^k$ on $M$ . dg.differential-geometry riemannian-geometry sg.symplectic-geometry smooth-manifolds Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked May 29, 2017 at 14:49 Ali Taghavi 1 $\\endgroup$ 5 1 $\\begingroup$ Reminds me of Courant algebroid constructions. Is that what you're going for? $\\endgroup$ AHusain –  AHusain 2017-05-29 17:15:20 +00:00 Commented May 29, 2017 at 17:15 $\\begingroup$ @AHusain thanks for your comment. I am not aware of such construction. Is this construction related to my question? I search in wikipedia for Courant algebroid. Thank you for informing me of that. $\\endgroup$ Ali Taghavi –  Ali Taghavi 2017-05-29 18:56:51 +00:00 Commented May 29, 2017 at 18:56 $\\begingroup$ Actually, it is almost the opposite of this question. There you typically want the map $E \\to E \\bigoplus E$ (turn one into $E^\\vee$) to give pullback $0$ rather than as big as possible. $\\endgroup$ AHusain –  AHusain 2017-05-29 19:18:49 +00:00 Commented May 29, 2017 at 19:18 $\\begingroup$ @AHusain Are you referring to the folowing concept? en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant_algebroid $\\endgroup$ Ali Taghavi –  Ali Taghavi 2017-05-29 20:01:32 +00:00 Commented May 29, 2017 at 20:01 $\\begingroup$ @AHusain I really do not understand the relation to my question. $\\endgroup$ Ali Taghavi –  Ali Taghavi 2017-05-29 20:02:08 +00:00 Commented May 29, 2017 at 20:02 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
