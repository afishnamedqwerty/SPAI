  "title": "dg.differential geometry - $SU(n)$ character variety of integral homology spheres",
  "body": "Suppose that $Y$ is an integral homology $3$ -sphere. Is it true that, for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ , there is always an irreducible representation $\\pi_{1}(Y) \\rightarrow SU(n)$ ? I'm also happy to see the answer when the Lie group is replaced by $SL(n, \\mathbb{C})$ or $PSL(n, \\mathbb{C})$ , but keeping irreducible unchanged. Edit: In this paper , Zentner proved the statement positively for $SL(2, \\mathbb{C})$ . It might be true that there is a threshold $n$ such that there is no more $SU(N)$ irreducible representations for $N \\geq n$ . The question was stated in this way because constructing counter-examples to the vanishing statement might be easier. dg.differential-geometry rt.representation-theory gt.geometric-topology Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 8, 2020 at 1:32 Kenta Suzuki 4,837 1 1 gold badge 13 13 silver badges 42 42 bronze badges asked Jul 5, 2020 at 1:40 Shaoyun Bai 945 5 5 silver badges 11 11 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 2 $\\begingroup$ The Poincaré homology sphere has fundamental group the binary icosahedral group, which is finite and therefore admits only finitely many irreducible representations. $\\endgroup$ Joshua Mundinger –  Joshua Mundinger 2020-07-05 13:16:44 +00:00 Commented Jul 5, 2020 at 13:16 $\\begingroup$ Yes, my motivation of asking this question is to see if this failure holds in much more generality. $\\endgroup$ Shaoyun Bai –  Shaoyun Bai 2020-07-05 16:56:56 +00:00 Commented Jul 5, 2020 at 16:56 $\\begingroup$ So you are asking: for all $n \\in \\mathbb N$, is there an integral homology 3-sphere $Y$ with an irreducible $\\pi_1(Y) \\to SU(n)$? $\\endgroup$ Joshua Mundinger –  Joshua Mundinger 2020-07-05 17:29:20 +00:00 Commented Jul 5, 2020 at 17:29 1 $\\begingroup$ No, I am asking if $Y$ is fixed, can you find such representations. As you pointed out this is not true if Y is the Poincar\\'e homology sphere, the question is about whether this failure holds for all $Y$. $\\endgroup$ Shaoyun Bai –  Shaoyun Bai 2020-07-05 18:11:31 +00:00 Commented Jul 5, 2020 at 18:11 $\\begingroup$ It should be true that for a given closed 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group, there is an irreducible $SU(N)$ representation for $N$ sufficiently large. But the case of homology spheres and $n=2$ is a well-known open question, so I think your question as stated is probably difficult. $\\endgroup$ Ian Agol –  Ian Agol 2020-07-05 20:15:49 +00:00 Commented Jul 5, 2020 at 20:15 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
