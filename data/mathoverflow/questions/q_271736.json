  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - For which monic irreducible $f \\in \\mathbb{C}[x,y][T]$, $\\mathbb{C}[x,y][T]/(f)$ is a UFD?",
  "body": "Let $f=f(T) \\in \\mathbb{C}[x,y][T]$ be a monic irreducible polynomial: $f=T^n+a_{n-1}T^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_1T+a_0$ , $a_j \\in \\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ , $0 \\leq j \\leq n-1$ . Denote $B=\\mathbb{C}[x,y,T]/(f)=\\mathbb{C}[x,y][w]$ , where $w^n+a_{n-1}w^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_1w+a_0=0$ . Of course, $\\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ is a UFD; however, it seems that $B$ does not have to be a UFD (for example, if $f=T^2-xy$ , then $B$ is not a UFD, since $w^2=xy$ ). (1) Is it possible to find a general form of $f$ , for which $B$ is a UFD? (2) What happens if we do not assume that $f$ is monic? (I guess being monic may yield a nicer answer?). (3) It seems (at least to me) that the answer of Ben Webster to this question is relevant. Perhaps relevant questions are the following: 1 and 2 (which asks when a quotient of a UFD is a UFD).

Otherwise, would you please clarify how \"UFD\" is defined in the presence of zero divisors? $\\endgroup$ Johannes Hahn –  Johannes Hahn 2017-06-08 19:44:10 +00:00 Commented Jun 8, 2017 at 19:44 $\\begingroup$ A Noetherian domain $R$ is a UFD if and only if it is normal with $\\operatorname{Cl}(R) = 0$. Neither of these can be easily read of from $f$. For example, there are polynomials of arbitrary degree for which $R$ is and is not a UFD: $T^n - x$ always gives a UFD (namely $\\mathbb C[y,T]$), and $T^n - xy$ never does if $n > 1$ (as $T^n = xy$). $\\endgroup$ R. van Dobben de Bruyn –  R. van Dobben de Bruyn 2017-06-08 21:07:30 +00:00 Commented Jun 8, 2017 at 21:07 $\\begingroup$ @JohannesHahn, thanks. Yes, I had in mind an integral domain $B$, so I will add to my question the assumption that $f$ is a prime (=irreducible) element of $\\mathbb{C}[x,y,T]$. I guess it is quite complicated to describe all the irreducibles of the polynomial ring in three variables. (In order to be a UFD there should be some additional restrictions). $\\endgroup$ user237522 –  user237522 2017-06-08 21:52:34 +00:00 Commented Jun 8, 2017 at 21:52 $\\begingroup$ Perhaps I should first ask my question with one less variable. Even in this case, I am not sure if it is possible to describe all irreducible polynomials in two variables, only bring several (nice) sufficient conditions, which are brought in mathoverflow.net/questions/14076/… $\\endgroup$ user237522 –  user237522 2017-06-08 21:56:07 +00:00 Commented Jun 8, 2017 at 21:56 1 $\\begingroup$ For normality, you have to check that $R$ is regular in codimension one (by Serre's criterion, noting that $S_2$ is always satisfied for hypersurfaces). In this case that means that the singular locus is only a finite set of points in $\\mathbb A^3$. You can use the Jacobian criterion to compute the singular locus for any given polynomial, but it's not so obvious when it has codimension at least $2$. There is no direct parametrisation of polynomials satisfying this. $\\endgroup$ R. van Dobben de Bruyn –  R. van Dobben de Bruyn 2017-06-09 00:17:15 +00:00 Commented Jun 9, 2017 at 0:17  |  Show 5 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
