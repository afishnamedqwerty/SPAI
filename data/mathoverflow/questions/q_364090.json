  "title": "ac.commutative algebra - Can an abelian group have multiple different actions of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$?",
  "body": "This is perhaps a trivial question, but I've asked a few colleagues and they couldn't answer. For a given abelian group $M$ , is it possible to have several different actions of the ring of $p$ -adic numbers $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ ? Or is it necessarily unique when it exists? If the action were continuous of some sort then it would have to be unique: integers are dense in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ , and for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ one has $n \\cdot x = x + \\dots + x$ ( $n$ times) so the action (if it exists) cannot be changed. But what if there are no assumptions about continuity? (To be completely precise: by an action, I just mean a bilinear map $\\mathbb{Z}_p \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} M \\to M$ satisfying $a \\cdot (b \\cdot m) = ab \\cdot m$ .) ac.commutative-algebra p-adic-numbers Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jun 25, 2020 at 8:15 user160178 21 1 1 bronze badge $\\endgroup$ 8 2 $\\begingroup$ Let $R$ be a commutative ring which admits two distinct ring homomorphisms $\\mathbb Z_p\\to R$, e.g. $R=\\mathbb C$. Now take an abelian group $M$ such that $R$ embeds into the endomorphisms of $M$, e.g. $M=R$ viewed as a group. $\\endgroup$ Wojowu –  Wojowu 2020-06-25 08:24:17 +00:00 Commented Jun 25, 2020 at 8:24 1 $\\begingroup$ No you won't explicitly exhibit any such homomorphism at all. But for $x$ transcendental in $\\mathbf{Z}_p$, for every transcendental $t$ in $\\mathbf{C}$ there exists a ring homomorphism $\\mathbf{Z}_p\\to\\mathbf{C}$ mapping $x$ to $t$ (it makes use of AC). $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-06-25 08:32:49 +00:00 Commented Jun 25, 2020 at 8:32 2 $\\begingroup$ An alternative is to consider the two obvious homomorphisms $\\mathbf{Z}_p\\to\\mathbf{Z}_p\\otimes_{\\mathbf{Z}}\\mathbf{Z}_p=:B$. While these homomorphisms are explicit, the fact that they are distinct (i.e., that $B$ is not reduced to $\\mathbf{Z}_p$) makes use of some choice as far as I know. $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-06-25 08:35:00 +00:00 Commented Jun 25, 2020 at 8:35 1 $\\begingroup$ In fact I think YCor's example is in some sense \"universal\" (for lack of a better word), in that for a map of commutative rings $A\\to B$, if the two maps $B\\to B\\otimes_A B$ agree, then the restriction $\\mathrm{Mod}_B\\to \\mathrm{Mod}_A$ is fully faithful; so an $A$-module either is or isn't a $B$-module, but there is only one way to make it so. $\\endgroup$ Maxime Ramzi –  Maxime Ramzi 2020-06-25 10:40:47 +00:00 Commented Jun 25, 2020 at 10:40 2 $\\begingroup$ Thinking twice, I tend to guess that \"the two canonical maps $\\mathbf{Z}_p\\to \\mathbf{Z}_p\\otimes_\\mathbf{Z} \\mathbf{Z}_p$ are distinct\", holds in ZF. Namely choose $x$ transcendental: the claim is that $x\\otimes 1$ and $1\\otimes x$ are distinct. Otherwise we have some \"relation\" saying that they are equal, and this relation holds in some finitely generated subring of $\\mathbf{Z}_p$ containing $x$, and in the latter I guess that we distinguish by making an explicit pair of homomorphisms. $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-06-25 11:01:21 +00:00 Commented Jun 25, 2020 at 11:01  |  Show 3 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
