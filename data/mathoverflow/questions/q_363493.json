  "body": "Let $A$ be a normed *-algebra with $\\|x^*x\\|=\\|x\\|^2$ . Suppose that for every subset S of A, the left annihilator ${\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Ann} _{L}(S)=\\{a\\in A\\mid \\forall s\\in S,as=0\\}\\,}$ is generated as a left ideal by some projection p of A. Q. Is $A$ norm complete (i.e., an AW*-algebra)? fa.functional-analysis oa.operator-algebras c-star-algebras Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jun 19, 2020 at 5:40 ABB 4,150 1 1 gold badge 13 13 silver badges 19 19 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 2 $\\begingroup$ How about the subalgebra of those functions in $\\ell_\\infty({\\bf N})$ that take only finitely many values? $\\endgroup$ Narutaka OZAWA –  Narutaka OZAWA 2020-06-19 06:16:34 +00:00 Commented Jun 19, 2020 at 6:16 $\\begingroup$ Yes, it is a nice countra-example.
