  "title": "dg.differential geometry - A differential operator associated with a vector field on the torus",
  "body": "Assume that $X$ is a non vanishing vector field on the torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$ . We define two linear operators $T,S$ on the space of smooth functions on $\\mathbb{T}^2$ as follows: $T(f)=X.f$ $S(f)= *d(\\alpha_{f})$ where $*$ is the Hodge operator and $\\alpha_{f}$ is the $1\\; \\_$ form on the torus with $\\alpha_{f}(h)=fX.h$ the later is based on a Riemannian metric on the torus. Is $D=T^2+S^2$ an elliptic operator?If yes is its index depend on the vector field $X$ and a Riemannain metric on the torus?If the index depends on $X$ , are there some dynamical interpretation for the index of this operator? dg.differential-geometry riemannian-geometry ds.dynamical-systems differential-operators index-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Mar 25, 2019 at 12:45 asked Jun 22, 2017 at 7:52 Ali Taghavi 1 $\\endgroup$ 10 $\\begingroup$ so $h$ is a vector field right ? $\\endgroup$ Thomas Richard –  Thomas Richard 2017-06-22 08:16:12 +00:00 Commented Jun 22, 2017 at 8:16 $\\begingroup$ @ThomasRichard Yes it is a tangent vector. $\\endgroup$ Ali Taghavi –  Ali Taghavi 2017-06-22 08:18:37 +00:00 Commented Jun 22, 2017 at 8:18 4 $\\begingroup$ Computations show that $Df=|X|_g^2\\Delta_g f+\\dots$ where the terms in the dots depend on $f$ and $df$. So ellipticity is ok since your vector field is non vanishing, as for the index I have no idea. $\\endgroup$ Thomas Richard –  Thomas Richard 2017-06-22 08:36:08 +00:00 Commented Jun 22, 2017 at 8:36 2 $\\begingroup$ What kind of index are you thinking of? The operator described by @ThomasRichard has selfadjoint principal symbol, so the classical definition (dim ker - dim coker) does not give anything interesting. $\\endgroup$ Sebastian Goette –  Sebastian Goette 2017-06-24 09:04:19 +00:00 Commented Jun 24, 2017 at 9:04 1 $\\begingroup$ In some cases, there are exotic indices, e.g. the parity of dim ker could be an invariant. Please check the book by Lawson-Michelsohn for details. $\\endgroup$ Sebastian Goette –  Sebastian Goette 2017-06-25 07:24:15 +00:00 Commented Jun 25, 2017 at 7:24  |  Show 5 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
