Being $\\mathfrak{h}$-submodules, these are graded submodules of $\\mathfrak{n}_+$, hence given by a subset $F$ of the set of positive roots $\\Phi_+$ (in particular, there are finitely many). The condition of being abelian means that $x+y\\notin\\Phi_+$ for all $x,y\\in F$. The condition of being an ideal of $\\mathfrak{n}_+$ means that if $x\\in\\Phi_+$ and $y\\in F$ and $x+y\\in\\Phi_+$ then $x+y\\in F$. $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-07-11 09:15:32 +00:00 Commented Jul 11, 2020 at 9:15 $\\begingroup$ (I assumed a split semisimple Lie algebra in char 0, e.g., complex simple) $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-07-11 09:18:20 +00:00 Commented Jul 11, 2020 at 9:18 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
