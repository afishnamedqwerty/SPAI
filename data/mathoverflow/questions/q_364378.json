  "title": "Derivative of matrix argument function with respect to eigenvalues of argument",
  "body": "Let $\\mathsf{SPD}_n$ denote the set of all real symmetric and positive definite $n\\times n$ matrices. This set is convex so for every $A,B\\in\\mathsf{SPD}_n$ there exists a smooth path $\\varphi:[0,1]\\rightarrow\\mathsf{SPD}_n$ , i.e. $\\varphi$ is a smooth function with $\\varphi(0) = A$ and $\\varphi(1) = B$ . Let $f:\\mathsf{SPD}_n\\rightarrow \\mathbb R$ . I am interested in the derivative: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}f(\\varphi(t))$ . By the usual chain rule, this is $$\\mathfrak Df(\\varphi(t))\\cdot\\dot\\varphi(t),$$ where $\\mathfrak Df$ is the derivative of $f$ with respect to its argument (i.e. a matrix) and $\\dot\\varphi$ the derivative along the path. Note that $\\cdot$ denotes the Frobenius inner product. This is my setting. Since $\\varphi(t)$ is a symmetric matrix for every $t$ , there should exist orthonormal matrices $V(t)$ and diagonal matrices $\\Lambda(t)$ such that $\\varphi(t) = V(t)\\Lambda(t)V(t)'$ . Is there any chance to restate my setting (perhaps under additional assumptions) such that $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}f(\\varphi(t)) = \\mathfrak Df(\\varphi(t))\\cdot\\dot\\psi(t),$$ where $\\dot\\psi$ is a vector valued function and $$ \\mathfrak Df(M) = \\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\lambda_1}f(M) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\lambda_2}f(M) \\\\\\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\lambda_n}f(M)\\end{array}\\right] $$ now is the vector of derivatives wrt to the eigenvalues of the argument of $f$ ? Consequently, $\\cdot$ denotes now the usual Euclidean inner product. In words: can $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}f(\\varphi(t))$ can be represented by $$\\text{derivative of $f$ wrt eigenvalues of argument} \\times \\text{something} $$ ? Background: The above is trivially true if I consider the set of diagonal matrices (because eigenvalues and diagonal elements elements coincide). Now I want to adapt the setting for spd matrices. In my application, $A$ and $B$ are covariance matrices. $A$ is the sample covariance and $B$ is a \"target\" covariance. On the way (i.e. along $\\varphi$ ) from $A$ to $B$ dimension reduction should be performed. The dimension reduction works similarily to PCA which is why I need to take the derivative wrt eigenvalues: if $\\left\\vert\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\lambda_j(t)}f(\\varphi(t)\\right\\vert<\\xi$ for some threshold $\\xi>0$ , \"dimension\" $j$ is ignored. eigenvalues matrix-theory path-connected Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 29, 2020 at 0:36 asked Jun 29, 2020 at 0:25 Syd Amerikaner 105 7 7 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ You can use the multidimensional chain rule and then product rule (since you have written $\\varphi(t)$ as a product of three matrices). Product rule for matrices is $\\frac{d}{dt}(AB)=\\frac{dA}{dt}B+A\\frac{dB}{dt}$ $\\endgroup$ Sam Zbarsky –  Sam Zbarsky 2020-06-29 02:14:42 +00:00 Commented Jun 29, 2020 at 2:14 $\\begingroup$ computing the ordinary derivative is no problem. My problem is that I want to express the derivative in terms of the derivative with respect to the eigenvalues of the argument. $\\endgroup$ Syd Amerikaner –  Syd Amerikaner 2020-06-29 11:46:11 +00:00 Commented Jun 29, 2020 at 11:46 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
