If not appropriate I can take it down or just use $\\mathbb F_q$ since that does not change the nature of the question. $\\endgroup$ VS. –  VS. 2020-07-10 14:24:16 +00:00 Commented Jul 10, 2020 at 14:24 1 $\\begingroup$ And even define $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ as it's both used for $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ and for the $n$-adics (projective limit of $\\mathbb{Z}/n^k\\mathbb{Z}$). $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-07-10 14:30:39 +00:00 Commented Jul 10, 2020 at 14:30 6 $\\begingroup$ For $n$ prime we have Schoof's algorithm which is polynomial in the number of bits, so all these problems are in $P$. For other $n$ the hardest step might be factoring, which is not believed to be polynomial time, but also not expected to be hard for any of these hardness classes. $\\endgroup$ Will Sawin –  Will Sawin 2020-07-10 15:17:35 +00:00 Commented Jul 10, 2020 at 15:17 3 $\\begingroup$ For a reference, see the Wikipedia page on \"Counting points on elliptic curves\" en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_points_on_elliptic_curves $\\endgroup$ Will Sawin –  Will Sawin 2020-07-10 15:23:42 +00:00 Commented Jul 10, 2020 at 15:23  |  Show 5 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
