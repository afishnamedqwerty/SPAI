  "title": "nt.number theory - Bound for $|p_n - \\operatorname{li}^{-1}(n)|$",
  "body": "It is well-known that $|\\pi(x)-\\operatorname{li}(x)| \\leq \\epsilon(x)$ , where $\\pi(x) = \\sum \\limits_{p \\leq x} 1$ is the prime counting function, where $\\operatorname{li}(x) = \\int \\limits_{2}^{x}\\frac{1}{\\ln(t)} dt$ is the logarithmic integral, and where the function $\\epsilon$ satisfies $\\lim \\limits_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon(x)}{\\operatorname{li}(x)} = 0$ . My question is as follows: Is anything known about an upper bound for $|p_n - \\operatorname{li}^{-1}(n)|$ ? Here $p_n$ is the $n$ -th prime.

I think this is what i am looking for, but i don't understand the $O$ notation, could any one give me precise answer. $\\endgroup$ Ahmad –  Ahmad 2017-03-22 21:04:20 +00:00 Commented Mar 22, 2017 at 21:04 1 $\\begingroup$ In analytic number theory, $O(f(x))$ denotes any function whose absolute value is less than some constant times $|f(x)|$. So if you have a good approximation $\\pi(x)\\approx\\mathrm{li}(x)$, then you have a good approximation $p_n\\approx\\mathrm{li}^{-1}(n)$. It is straightforward to work out the relation of the two $O$-constants in the result you quote. $\\endgroup$ GH from MO –  GH from MO 2017-03-22 21:52:29 +00:00 Commented Mar 22, 2017 at 21:52 1 $\\begingroup$ So you can read off a concrete bound from my response to your earlier question: mathoverflow.net/questions/260959/… $\\endgroup$ GH from MO –  GH from MO 2017-03-22 21:53:46 +00:00 Commented Mar 22, 2017 at 21:53 $\\begingroup$ @GHfromMO yes, but i wanted to generalize the question to any given bound. $\\endgroup$ Ahmad –  Ahmad 2017-03-22 22:25:36 +00:00 Commented Mar 22, 2017 at 22:25 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
