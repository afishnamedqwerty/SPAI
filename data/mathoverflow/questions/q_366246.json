  "body": "\"Classically\", if we consider an abelian variety $A$ over some number field $k$ , we get a $Gal(\\bar{k}/k)$ -module $A(\\bar{k})$ , or equivalently a sheaf of abelian groups on the étale site $\\text{Spec}(k)_{ét}$ . In particular, we can apply the machinery of Galois cohomology. My question is if there is a similar construction for abelian stacks. If we have commutative group stacks over number field $k$ with a short exact sequence $$0\\rightarrow A\\rightarrow B\\rightarrow C\\rightarrow 0$$ is there a universal way of extending the left exact sequence $$0\\rightarrow A(k)\\rightarrow B(k)\\rightarrow C(k)$$ i.e. something akin to $H^i(G_k,A)$ ? My thinking is that we have an exact triangle $$A^\\flat\\rightarrow B^\\flat\\rightarrow C^\\flat \\rightarrow A^\\flat[1]$$ in $D(\\text{Spec}(k)$ on which we can apply the global sections functor. Would that give us something relevant? ag.algebraic-geometry arithmetic-geometry algebraic-number-theory derived-categories algebraic-stacks Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 22, 2020 at 0:09 curious math guy 4,438 10 10 silver badges 36 36 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 $\\begingroup$ This paper by Noohi might be relevant: Group cohomology with coefficients in a crossed module Journal of the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu, 10(2) (2011) 359–404. doi.org/10.1017/S1474748010000186 arxiv.org/abs/0902.0161 $\\endgroup$ David Roberts –  David Roberts ♦ 2020-07-22 00:51:53 +00:00 Commented Jul 22, 2020 at 0:51 $\\begingroup$ including the definition of $A^\\flat$ looks like a good idea $\\endgroup$ Niels –  Niels 2020-07-22 15:36:26 +00:00 Commented Jul 22, 2020 at 15:36 $\\begingroup$ @Niels, I appolozige, I assumed this is standard notation. Denote by $C(k)$ the $2$-category of complexes of abelian sheaves $G^\\bullet$ over $\\text{Spec}(k)$ such that $^G^i=0$ for $i\\neq 0,-1$ and such that $G^{-1}$ is injective. Then there exists an equivalence of $2$-categories between commutative group schemes and $C(\\text{Spec}(k))$, which we denote by $\\flat$. My reference for this is Section 2 of arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0285.pdf . $\\endgroup$ curious math guy –  curious math guy 2020-07-22 16:56:56 +00:00 Commented Jul 22, 2020 at 16:56 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
