  "body": "If $X$ is a finite $p$ -local spectrum, then the minimal number of cells needed to construct $X$ is exactly $\\dim_{\\mathbb F_p} H_\\ast(X,\\mathbb F_p)$ . Is there an analogous result in the $K(n)$ -local setting? One should be a bit careful in formulating this question. After all, the $K(n)$ -local category $Sp_{K(n)}$ has a nontrivial Picard group; these are spectra $X$ with $\\dim_{K(n)_\\ast} K(n)_\\ast(X) = 1$ which are not suspensions of the $K(n)$ -local sphere spectrum $\\mathbb S_{K(n)}$ . There are also many possible notions of \"finite\". So there are several versions of this question. First, some notation. Given a full subcategory $\\mathcal C \\subseteq \\mathcal D$ , define $\\mathcal C_0 = \\{0\\}$ , and inductively let $\\mathcal C_{n+1} \\subseteq \\mathcal D$ be the full subcategory of objects $D \\in \\mathcal D$ such that there exists a cofiber sequence $C \\to C' \\to D$ with $C \\in \\mathcal C$ and $C' \\in \\mathcal C_n$ . For $C \\in \\cup_{n \\in \\mathbb N} \\mathcal C_n$ , define $$numcells_{\\mathcal C}(C)$$ to be the minimal $n \\in \\mathbb N$ such that $C \\in \\mathcal C_n$ ; define $numcells_{\\mathcal C}(X) = \\infty$ if $X \\not \\in \\cup_{n \\in \\mathbb N} \\mathcal C_n$ . Clearly, if $X \\in Sp_{K(n)}$ , we have $$numcells_{Pic(Sp_{K(n)})} (X) \\geq \\dim_{K(n)_\\ast} K(n)_\\ast(X)$$ and, more weakly, $$numcells_{\\{\\Sigma^k \\mathbb S_{K(n)}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb Z}}(X) \\geq \\dim_{K(n)_\\ast} K(n)_\\ast(X)$$ My questions are about whether equality is \"always\" attained. Question: Let $Y$ be a finite $p$ -local spectrum. Then do we have $numcells_{\\{\\Sigma^k \\mathbb S_{K(n)}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb Z}}(L_{K(n)} Y) = \\dim_{K(n)_\\ast} K(n)_\\ast(Y)$ ? More generally, let $X \\in Sp_{K(n)}$ be such that $numcells_{\\{\\Sigma^k \\mathbb S_{K(n)}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb Z}}(X)< \\infty$ . Then do we have $numcells_{\\{\\Sigma^k \\mathbb S_{K(n)}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb Z}}(X) = \\dim_{K(n)_\\ast} K(n)_\\ast(X)$ ? In a slightly different direction, let $X \\in Sp_{K(n)}$ . Then do we have $numcells_{Pic(Sp_{K(n)})} (X) = \\dim_{K(n)_\\ast} K(n)_\\ast(X)$ ? I'd also be interested in these questions $T(n)$ -locally (in fact, what I'm actually most interested in is the $T(n)$ -local version of Question (1)) but probably such versions of the questions are much harder. It might also be interesting to ask about $numcells_{\\{\\Sigma^k L_{K(n)} F(n)\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb Z}}(X)$ where $F(n)$ is a finite type- $n$ spectrum. at.algebraic-topology homotopy-theory chromatic-homotopy Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 21, 2020 at 5:16 asked Jun 20, 2020 at 18:45 Tim Campion 67k 13 13 gold badges 158 158 silver badges 416 416 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 $\\begingroup$ This addresses none of your questions, but you (or onlookers interested in some of the subtleties you’ve incorporated into the question) might also be interested in the spectrum Y analyzed on page 75 of the Hovey-Strickland memoir. $\\endgroup$ Eric Peterson –  Eric Peterson 2020-06-21 04:21:39 +00:00 Commented Jun 21, 2020 at 4:21 $\\begingroup$ Also, I don’t understand the difference between (3) and the start of the “Clearly…” paragraph. $\\endgroup$ Eric Peterson –  Eric Peterson 2020-06-21 04:22:29 +00:00 Commented Jun 21, 2020 at 4:22 $\\begingroup$ @EricPeterson Ah, thanks.
