  "body": "Let $j(q) = \\sum_{n \\geq -1} c(n) q^n$ be the usual modular $j$ invariant. Given a prime $p$ , and a real number $x$ , I am interested in the number $$\\psi(p,x) = \\# \\{n \\leq x,\\ p \\nmid c(n)\\}.$$ I'd like to know what is proved, and what is conjectured, about the asymptotics of $\\psi(p,x)$ when $x \\rightarrow \\infty$ . I have spent a lot of time trying to skim the literature, but it is too abundant: I found many interesting papers concerning related questions, but no global picture emerges. So I decided to ask MO. Here are the two questions I ask: (1) Is it known that for all $p$ , $\\psi(p,x)$ goes to infinity with $x$ ? (2) Has someone conjectured that $\\psi(p,x) \\gg x$ when $x \\rightarrow \\infty$ ? (and if so, is it known in any case ?) What I know: The answer to (1) is yes if $p=2$ or if $p\\geq 13$ . For $p=2$ , it is proven in a paper of Zanello (Journal of Number Theory Volume 151, June 2015, Pages 107–115), that $\\psi(2,x) \\geq x^{1/2}(\\log \\log x)/(\\log x)$ . If $p \\geq 13$ , then it is not hard to show that $U_p j$ is a non-constant $p$ -adic modular form, hence congruent to a classical form mod p, and one obtains $\\psi(p,x) \\gg x/(\\log x)^{3/4} $ . But when $p=3,5,7,11$ , I do not know the answer to question (1). For the conjecture (2), I have only seen it conjectured for $p=2$ , in a paper of Alfes who attributes the conjecture to Ken Ono, without reference. nt.number-theory modular-forms Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Dec 23, 2016 at 5:25 Joël 26.4k 2 2 gold badges 102 102 silver badges 200 200 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 6 1 $\\begingroup$ A minor point, affecting only $p=3$ (in a minor way) - do you mean $J=j/1728$?

I've proved (J Number Theory 58 (1996) 55-59) that $j$ is in fact transcendental over ${\\mathbb F}_p(q)$. $\\endgroup$ Felipe Voloch –  Felipe Voloch 2016-12-23 08:39:32 +00:00 Commented Dec 23, 2016 at 8:39 $\\begingroup$ Why can we not proceed with the $U_p$ trick for all $p$? We can think of $j$ as an overconvergent weight 0 form with a pole at the cusp, so $U_p(j)$ also has this property, but it's holomorphic at the cusp, so it's overconvergent weight 0 with no poles, so congruent to a classical form mod $p$ (you don't even need overconvergence right, you just need that it's a $p$-adic form). Why do you restrict to $p\\geq13$ -- what am I missing? If the reduction is identically zero then you can just divide by $p$ because of the $q$-expansion principle, right? $\\endgroup$ znt –  znt 2016-12-23 22:15:00 +00:00 Commented Dec 23, 2016 at 22:15 $\\begingroup$ @znt. Good question. The problem is that $U_p j$ is indeed over convergent weight 0 with no poles for all $p$, but for $p<13$, it is actually the constant 744 (see Serre, Divisibilité de certaines fonctions arithmétiques, exercises). For $p \\geq 13$, $U_p j$ is a form of filtration $p-1$ (loc. cit.) hence not a constant. $\\endgroup$ Joël –  Joël 2016-12-24 04:47:39 +00:00 Commented Dec 24, 2016 at 4:47 $\\begingroup$ @Felipe. Quite interesting. (And I see how I missed this in my mathscinet search: all my query had the word coefficients in them).This might be an answer. $\\endgroup$ Joël –  Joël 2016-12-24 04:48:47 +00:00 Commented Dec 24, 2016 at 4:48  |  Show 1 more comment 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
