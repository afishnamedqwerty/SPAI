  "body": "Let $X = x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_n$ and $Y = y_1 + y_2 + \\ldots + y_n$ , where each $x_i$ is an independent Bernoulli random variable with success probability $p_i$ and each $y_i$ is a Bernoulli random variable with success probability $q_i$ . In addition, suppose that $\\sum_i p_i = c +\\sum_j q_j$ for some constant $c>5$ . My question is, whether or not the inequality $$ \\mathbb{P}(X-Y =2) \\geq \\mathbb{P}(X-Y=1) $$ always holds? st.statistics bernoulli-trial Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 30, 2020 at 23:38 YCor 67.5k 5 5 gold badges 203 203 silver badges 301 301 bronze badges asked Jun 29, 2020 at 16:49 Masood 169 6 6 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 6 1 $\\begingroup$ Do you assume that all random variables $x_1,\\ldots,x_n,y_1,\\ldots,y_n$ are independent? $\\endgroup$ Dieter Kadelka –  Dieter Kadelka 2020-06-29 17:54:47 +00:00 Commented Jun 29, 2020 at 17:54 $\\begingroup$ Yes, all the variables are independent. $\\endgroup$ Masood –  Masood 2020-06-29 18:08:26 +00:00 Commented Jun 29, 2020 at 18:08 1 $\\begingroup$ I guess $X$ and $Y$ are what's known as \"Poisson binomial\" random variables, and the question is basically whether a difference of two independent Poisson binomials is unimodal. $\\endgroup$ Bjørn Kjos-Hanssen –  Bjørn Kjos-Hanssen 2020-06-30 18:38:33 +00:00 Commented Jun 30, 2020 at 18:38 1 $\\begingroup$ Do you have investigated the limiting case that $X \\sim Po(\\lambda)$ and $Y \\sim Po(\\lambda-c)$ with $c > 5$ and $\\lambda > 5$ and $X,Y$ independent?

While I was searching for the correct answer, I found the following series of results: 1- both $X$ and $Y$ are unimodal and log-concave ( arxiv.org/pdf/0912.0581.pdf ) and 2- when one distribution is unimodal while the other one is log-concave, their difference is also unimodal (statement in the proof of proposition 7 in paper \"Precision May Harm: The Comparative Statics of Imprecise Judgement.\"). Is it correct? $\\endgroup$ Masood –  Masood 2020-07-02 14:06:45 +00:00 Commented Jul 2, 2020 at 14:06  |  Show 1 more comment 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
