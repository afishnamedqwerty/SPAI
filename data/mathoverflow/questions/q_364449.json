  "title": "pr.probability - Upper bounding the sum with hypergeometric and binomial probabilities",
  "body": "Could you please help me upper bound this tricky expression: $$P(A)=\\sum_{i=0}^n{\\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\binom kq \\binom {n-k}{i-q}}{\\binom {n}{i}} \\right)}^I \\binom ni p^i {(1-p)}^{n-i}$$ . So far I only managed to obtain a lower bound by proving $\\sum_{i=0}^n{\\dfrac{\\binom kq \\binom {n-k}{i-q}}{\\binom {n}{i}}\\binom ni p^i {(1-p)}^{n-i}}=\\binom kq p^q {(1-p)}^{k-q}$ and applying Jensen's inequality for power function $f(x):=x^I$ . This lower bound is $P(A) \\geq {\\left(1-\\binom kq p^q {(1-p)}^{k-q}\\right)}^I$ and works okay for my needs. However, I would like to get a similar upper bound too and this is what causes the main difficulty.
