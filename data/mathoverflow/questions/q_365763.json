  "body": "My first question on Math Overflow. For my Mathematics Bachelor thesis I am looking at a paper called \"Deep Limits of Residual Neural networks\" by Matthew Thorpe and Yves van Gennip. (arxiv.org link) In Lemma 4.6, a preliminary result to show that something Gamma-converges, they first show that a discretized ODE uniformly converges to the ODE itself. Some info you need: $X: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^d,$ $\\sigma$ is Lipschitz continuous with constant $L_{\\sigma}$ , $\\dot{X}(t) = \\sigma(K(t)X(t)+b(t)), \\quad t\\in[0,1], K: [0,1]\\to \\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}, b: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$ . The inequality that I cannot confirm: $$ \\sup_{s\\in[0,t]} || \\int_0^s \\dot{X}(r)dr + x|| \\leq \\sup_{s\\in[0,t]} L_\\sigma s ||X||_{L^{\\infty}([0,s])}||K||_{L^{\\infty}} + L_{\\sigma}||b||_{L^{\\infty}} + ||x||. $$ Now I expected $||b||_{L^{\\infty}}$ to also be scalar multiplied by $s$ . Here are my steps \\begin{align*} \\sup_{s\\in[0,t]} || \\int_0^s \\dot{X}(r)dr + x|| & \\leq \\sup_{s\\in[0,t]} || \\int_0^s \\sigma(K(r)X(r)+b(r)) dr|| + ||x|| \\\\ & \\leq \\sup_{s\\in[0,t]} L_{\\sigma}|| \\int_0^s K(r)X(r)dr + \\int_0^s b(r) dr|| + ||x||\\\\ & \\leq \\sup_{s\\in[0,t]} L_{\\sigma}\\Big( \\int_0^s ||K(r)X(r)||dr + \\int_0^s ||b(r)|| dr\\big) + ||x||\\\\ & \\leq \\sup_{s\\in[0,t]} L_{\\sigma}\\Big( ||KX||_{L^{\\infty}} \\int_0^s dr + ||b||_{L^{\\infty}}\\int_0^s dr\\Big) + ||x||\\\\ & \\leq \\sup_{s\\in[0,t]} L_{\\sigma}\\Big( ||K||_{L^\\infty}||X||_{L^{\\infty}}\\cdot s + ||b||_{L^{\\infty}}\\cdot s\\Big) + ||x||. \\end{align*} So I think the $s$ in front of $||K|| ||X||$ comes from integrating over $\\mathcal{1}$ , and therefore the same thing should happen for $b$ . Also: In the inequality in the paper they use the $L^{\\infty}([0,s])$ norm for $X$ and the $L^{\\infty}$ norm for $K$ and $b$ on the right side, but I cannot explain this. Could this have something to do with the missing $s$ ? inequalities integration norms Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 16, 2020 at 9:40 The Coding Wombat 121 2 2 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 $\\begingroup$ If I understand correctly, $0 \\le s \\le1$. If you estimate $s$ by $1$ in your chain, then you get the bound you are looking for. $\\endgroup$ Giorgio Metafune –  Giorgio Metafune 2020-07-16 10:18:26 +00:00 Commented Jul 16, 2020 at 10:18 $\\begingroup$ @GiorgioMetafune So you're saying $t\\leq 1$? $\\endgroup$ The Coding Wombat –  The Coding Wombat 2020-07-16 10:47:40 +00:00 Commented Jul 16, 2020 at 10:47 $\\begingroup$ @GiorgioMetafune Later on they choose $t=\\frac{1}{2L_{\\sigma}||K||_{L^{\\infty}}}$ which is not necessarily $\\leq 1$ right? Even later they switch from $||X||_{L^{\\infty}([0,t])} \\leq 2L_\\sigma ||b||_{L^\\infty} + 2||x||$ to $||X||_{L^\\infty ([0,1])} \\leq 2(2^N - 1)L_{\\sigma} ||b||_{L^\\infty} + 2^N||x||$ with $N=\\left \\lceil{\\frac{1}{t}}\\right \\rceil $. Maybe if I understand how they switch there, I see why $t\\leq 1$? $\\endgroup$ The Coding Wombat –  The Coding Wombat 2020-07-16 11:00:12 +00:00 Commented Jul 16, 2020 at 11:00 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
