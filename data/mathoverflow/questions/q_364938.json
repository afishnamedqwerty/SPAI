  "body": "What is the probability that an integer $a$ picked uniformly in $[t/2,t]$ has a factor in $[t^{\\alpha},2t^{\\alpha}]$ where $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$ ? I am interested when $\\alpha=1/3$ but if there is a general result it would be useful. Is there a good asymptotic in terms of $t$ and $\\alpha$ and is it $1/\\mathrm{polylog}(t^\\alpha)$ ? nt.number-theory analytic-number-theory factorization Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 6, 2020 at 23:10 kodlu 10.6k 3 3 gold badges 37 37 silver badges 61 61 bronze badges asked Jul 6, 2020 at 10:21 VS. 1,846 1 1 gold badge 12 12 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
