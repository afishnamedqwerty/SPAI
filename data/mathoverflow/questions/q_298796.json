  "title": "rt.representation theory - Ext for simple modules in selfinjective algebras",
  "body": "Let $A$ be a finite dimensional symmetric algebra (given by a connected quiver and non-semisimple) and $S$ a simple $A$ -module. (I am more interested in symmetric algebras, but selfinjective examples are also welcome) Questions: Is there an easy example with $Ext_A^i(S,S)=0$ for all $i \\geq m$ for some $m$ ? (easy might mean that the example also works over finite fields) Can we have $Ext_A^m(S,S) \\neq 0$ for exactly one $m$ ? (In case $m=1$ this would give a counterexample to the extreme no loop conjecture) rt.representation-theory ra.rings-and-algebras homological-algebra Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Apr 26, 2018 at 15:12 Mare 28.3k 7 7 gold badges 26 26 silver badges 117 117 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
