  "body": "Suppose we have a 3-dimensional Euclidean cone-manifold $M$ —in my book that just means $M$ is a manifold whose geometry is constructed by gluing it out of Euclidean tetrahedra, with faces paired by isometries. $M$ shares many common properties with an $(\\mathbb{E}^3,\\mathrm{E}(3))$ -manifold: it has a universal cover $p:\\tilde{M}\\to M$ , constructed by removing its singular locus $M_s$ , taking the usual universal cover, and then re-inserting $M_s$ ; it has a developing map $\\mathrm{dev}:\\tilde{M}\\to\\mathbb{E}^3$ , and therefore it has a holonomy map $\\mathrm{hol}:\\pi_1(M\\setminus M_s)\\to\\mathrm{E}(3)$ , unique up to conjugacy (in older literature this is sometimes called the monodromy ). The image of the map $\\mathrm{hol}$ I denote by $\\mathrm{Hol}(M)$ . The definition of holonomy is such that, for any $x\\in M$ , any two elements of $\\mathrm{dev}(p^{-1}(x))$ are related by an element of $\\mathrm{Hol}(M)$ . Therefore the assignment $x\\mapsto q(\\mathrm{dev}(p^{-1}(x)))$ gives a well-defined map $q_M:M\\to\\mathbb{E}^3/\\mathrm{Hol}(M)$ , where $q:\\mathbb{E}^3\\to\\mathbb{E}^3/\\mathrm{Hol}(M)$ is the quotient map. This is the canonical map mentioned in the title. Now for my question. In the event that $\\mathbb{E}^3/\\mathrm{Hol}(M)$ is a suitably nice space (for instance, a compact Euclidean orbifold), what is known about this map $q_M$ ? It seems to arise so naturally that I feel it must have been studied before, probably in a more general setting. It seems to me that it should be a ramified covering map (a surjection which is a covering map outside of the singular locus).
