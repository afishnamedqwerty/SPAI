  "title": "Approximate unit in C*-algebra with additional properties",
  "body": "In the book K-Theory and $C^*$ -Algebras: A Friendly Approach by Niels Wegge-Olsen I came across the following notion: in Lemma 16.4 authors assume that the $C^*$ -algebra $A$ possess \"(commuting) approximate unit $(a_n)_n$ so that $a_{n+1}a_n=a_n$ \". In the next lemma the only assumption about $A$ is that $A$ is $\\sigma$ -unital, which means that there is some countable approximate unit. However the authors claim that in this case we may assume that this approximate unit is as above. Why we can assume that this approximate unit have this additional property (having assumed that $A$ is just $\\sigma$ -unital? oa.operator-algebras c-star-algebras Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 3, 2020 at 12:19 David Roberts ♦ 37k 13 13 gold badges 143 143 silver badges 388 388 bronze badges asked Jun 26, 2016 at 0:22 truebaran 9,654 6 6 gold badges 33 33 silver badges 100 100 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 3 $\\begingroup$ This is a functional calculus argument, IIRC.

Then if we fix a nonnegative element $a$ in our algebra $A$ (with norm $\\leq 1$) we can form $u_n=f_n(a)$ via functional calculus. It is clear for me that we therefore get an increaing sequence of nonnegative elements in the unit ball of $A$. However I don't quite understand why we get approximate unit, in other words why $\\|u_nx-x\\| \\to 0$ for each $x \\in A$? $\\endgroup$ truebaran –  truebaran 2016-06-26 18:51:28 +00:00 Commented Jun 26, 2016 at 18:51 $\\begingroup$ I also wonder where exactly do we use the assumption that our algebra is $\\sigma$-unital. In the comment to the question for which you gave a link one speaks about strictly positive element: I have problems in understanding what does it mean in the nonunital case (in the unital my guess would be positive and invertible) and how to obtain such an element (my guess is that here the assumption of being $\\sigma$-unital is used and one has to take something like $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{2^n}e_n$ where $(e_n)_n$ is some countable approximate unit). $\\endgroup$ truebaran –  truebaran 2016-06-26 18:56:47 +00:00 Commented Jun 26, 2016 at 18:56 1 $\\begingroup$ Strictly positive elements are defined here en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C *-algebra#Quotients_and_approximate_identities and it is not quite right to talk about invertibility in algebras which do not have identity elements. If your algebra is not sigma-unital then it won't have any strictly positive elements, see Section 1.4 of math.ucr.edu/~monnot/c%20algebras.pdf $\\endgroup$ Yemon Choi –  Yemon Choi 2016-06-27 17:57:02 +00:00 Commented Jun 27, 2016 at 17:57 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
