  "body": "Let $A,B$ be two Trace class operators with spectral decomposition $\\sum_{j\\geq 1} \\lambda_j \\phi_j(\\cdot)\\otimes \\phi_j(\\cdot)$ and $\\sum_{j\\geq 1} \\gamma_j \\psi_j(\\cdot)\\otimes \\psi_j(\\cdot)$ respectively. Can one say anything about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}$ maybe under further assumptions ? In particular I am curious if clean relationships exist between the eigenvalues of $A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}$ and $\\lambda_j$ , $\\gamma_j$ , for $j\\geq 1$ in some special cases ? fa.functional-analysis operator-theory eigenvalues Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Aug 4, 2020 at 6:17 Kcafe 509 3 3 silver badges 13 13 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 1 $\\begingroup$ the eigenvalues of $A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}$ are the same those of $AB$. $\\endgroup$ Carlo Beenakker –  Carlo Beenakker 2020-08-04 06:25:45 +00:00 Commented Aug 4, 2020 at 6:25 $\\begingroup$ Are you assuming $A$ is a positive trace class operator?
