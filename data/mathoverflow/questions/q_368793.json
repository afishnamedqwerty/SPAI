  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - Logarithmic Darboux theorem",
  "body": "Let $X$ be a smooth complex analytic manifold and $D$ be a normal crossing divisor. Suppose that there is a complex analytic logarithmic symplectic structure on $X$ . Is there a Darboux like theorem that says that the complex analytic log symplectic form on a neighbourhood of a point is $\\sum_{i=1}^r \\frac{dx_i}{x_i}\\wedge dx_{i+r}+\\sum_{j=1}^{2(n-r)-1} dx_{2r+j}\\wedge dx_{2r+j+1}$ , where $\\{x_i\\}$ 's are some local complex coordinates of $X$ and the divisor is given by the vanishing locus of $x_1\\cdots x_r$ ? If this is a known result an explanation or a reference of the proof will be very helpful. ag.algebraic-geometry dg.differential-geometry sg.symplectic-geometry moduli-spaces Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 10, 2020 at 12:14 asked Aug 10, 2020 at 11:38 S.D. 494 3 3 silver badges 9 9 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 1 $\\begingroup$ For b-symplectic manifolds (i.e. $r=1$), a Darboux theorem is established in arxiv.org/abs/1512.05303 $\\endgroup$ Tobias Diez –  Tobias Diez 2020-08-10 17:50:28 +00:00 Commented Aug 10, 2020 at 17:50 $\\begingroup$ @Tobias Diez thanks $\\endgroup$ S.D. –  S.D. 2020-08-11 08:56:40 +00:00 Commented Aug 11, 2020 at 8:56 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
