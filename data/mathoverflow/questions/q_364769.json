  "body": "Let $B$ be some matrix. Is there a way to decide whether there exists an invertible matrix $P$ , such that the matrix: $$ A = P^{-1}BP $$ Is non-negative? (That is - all the entries in the matrix are non-negative) Basically - given a linear transformation, I want to find a different base, in which the transformation matrix of this linear transformation is non-negative. For example, for the matrix: $$ B=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} $$ I have the matrix: $$ P=\\begin{bmatrix} 1&0\\\\ 1&1 \\end{bmatrix} $$ And $$ P^{-1}=\\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\\\ -1&1 \\end{bmatrix} $$ And: $$ A=P^{-1}BP= \\begin{bmatrix}1& 0\\\\ 1 &1 \\end{bmatrix} $$ Is there a way to efficiently decide if such matrix $P$ exists, and to find it? linear-algebra Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 3, 2020 at 18:13 Dolav 31 1 1 bronze badge $\\endgroup$ 4 3 $\\begingroup$ I assume that you are talking about real matrices. Well, notice that, if such an $A$ exists, then trace($B^{m}$) is non-negative for all non-negative integers $m$. $\\endgroup$ Geoff Robinson –  Geoff Robinson 2020-07-03 18:31:59 +00:00 Commented Jul 3, 2020 at 18:31 3 $\\begingroup$ a necessary condition is that $B$ has a real nonnegative eigenvalue $\\lambda$, and any other eigenvalue $\\lambda'$ satisfies $|\\lambda'|\\leq\\lambda$ (Perron-Frobenius theorem) $\\endgroup$ Carlo Beenakker –  Carlo Beenakker 2020-07-03 18:49:19 +00:00 Commented Jul 3, 2020 at 18:49 $\\begingroup$ In the 2 by 2 case, if $tr(B) \\geq 0$ and $B$ has real eigenvalues, then it is similar to a nonnegative matrix (symmetric, even). $\\endgroup$ user44191 –  user44191 2020-07-03 20:05:15 +00:00 Commented Jul 3, 2020 at 20:05 2 $\\begingroup$ There are necessary and sufficient conditions so that some power of $B$ is conjugate to a matrix with strictly positive entries, but this is not what you are are looking for. In general, conjugacy to a primitive matrix (a matrix with all entries nonnegative, and some power of the matrix is strictly positive) is a very difficult prolem. $\\endgroup$ David Handelman –  David Handelman 2020-07-03 23:08:02 +00:00 Commented Jul 3, 2020 at 23:08 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
