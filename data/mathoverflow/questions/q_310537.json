  "title": "complex geometry - Unobstructedness of nodal holomorphic curve in symplectic manifold",
  "body": "Suppose $(X,\\omega)$ is a compact symplectic manifold and $J$ is an $\\omega$ -compatible almost complex structure on $X$ (the symplectic structure seems to be irrelevant for this question actually). Suppose first that $C$ is a non-singular closed Riemann surface (say of genus $g$ equipped with $n$ marked points) and $f:C\\to X$ is a $J$ -holomorphic curve which is a stable map. Denote the complex structure on $C$ by $j$ . Letting $f_*[C] = \\beta\\in H_2(X,\\mathbb Z)$ , we can ask if the moduli space $\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}(X,J,\\beta)$ is transversely cut-out at the point $(C,f)$ , i.e., if it is \"unobstructed\". The answer to this is given by considering the following complex $L^\\bullet$ . Its terms are given by $L^0=\\Omega^0(C,TC)$ , $L^1 = \\Omega^{0,1}(C,TC)\\oplus\\Omega^0(C,f^*TX)$ and $L^2 = \\Omega^{0,1}(C,f^*TX)$ , where the last vector space is defined using $J$ . The map $L^0\\to L^1$ is given by the difference of the canonical $\\bar\\partial$ operator on $TC$ and the map $df:TC\\to f^*TX$ . The map $L^1\\to L^2$ is given by the sum of $df$ and the linearization $D_f\\bar\\partial_{J,j}$ (in the sense of McDuff-Salamon's book) of the $\\bar\\partial_{J,j}$ -operator at the point $f$ (which is a real-linear Cauchy Riemann operator). Stability is equivalent to $H^0(L^\\bullet)=0$ . Further, we can show that $(C,f)$ is unobstructed iff $H^2(L^\\bullet)=0$ . Now, suppose we replace $C$ by a nodal curve (of arithmetic genus $g$ and $n$ marked points) and suppose $f:C\\to X$ is a stable holomorphic map. We can ask if $(C,f)$ is unobstructed as an element of the moduli space $\\overline{\\mathcal M}_{g,n}(X,J,\\beta)$ . My question is then the following: Can we write down a complex which detects unobstructedness in the nodal case? In the case when $(X,J)$ is a genuine complex manifold, I believe that the cochain complex $\\text{RHom}_{C}(f^*\\Omega^1_X\\to\\Omega^1_C,\\mathcal O_C)$ answers this question (here, $\\Omega^1_X,\\Omega^1_C$ are the sheaves of Kähler differentials on $X,C$ respectively and the map $f^*\\Omega^1_X\\to\\Omega^1_C$ is the \"pull-back by $f$ \" map). However, in the case of a general symplectic manifold with a compatible almost complex structure, I think the answer might be subtle, since the usual route to investigating if $(C,f)$ is unobstructed in the nodal case seems to pass through the gluing theorem for holomorphic curves. complex-geometry deformation-theory symplectic-topology pseudo-holomorphic-curves Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 29, 2020 at 19:41 asked Sep 14, 2018 at 1:28 Mohan Swaminathan 1,861 10 10 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
