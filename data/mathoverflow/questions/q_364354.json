  "title": "real analysis - Natural candidates for super-half-exponential which limit to half-exponential function from above",
  "body": "There are no closed form candidates for half-exponential functions \"Closed-form\" functions with half-exponential growth . However super-half-exponentials (functions whose composition grows faster than exponential) have lot of candidates. Eg: $2^n$ itself. A little thought gives $f(0,a,n)=2^{n^a}$ , $f(1,a,n)=2^{2^{(\\log n)^a}}$ , $f(2,a,n)=2^{2^{2^{(\\log\\log n)^a}}}$ , $\\dots$ , $f(k,a,n)=2^{2^{^{\\dots}{^{{2^{(\\underbrace{\\log\\dots\\log}_{\\text{k }} n)^a}}}}}}$ etc. at fixed $a\\in(0,1)$ and fixed $k\\in\\mathbb Z\\cap[1,\\infty]$ . The functions grow slower as $k$ increases. Define $g_{upper}(a,n)=\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}f(k,a,n)$ . Is $g_{upper}(a,n)$ almost the half-exponential function? That is, does $g_{upper}(a,g_{upper}(a,n))=2^{O(n^{1+\\epsilon})}$ hold at every $a\\in(0,1)$ and at every $\\epsilon>0$ ? I do not think inductive arguments depending on finite $k$ work when $k\\rightarrow\\infty$ without knowing speed of $f(k,a,n)$ 's decrease as $k$ increases. It is possible $g_{upper}(a,n)$ is the half-exponential function. It is also possible $g_{upper}(a,n)$ and $g_{lower}(a,n)$ approach each other where $g_{lower}(a,n)$ is defined in Natural candidates for sub-half-exponential which limit to half-exponential function from below . That is $g_{upper}(a,g_{upper}(a,n))=2^{O(n)}$ holds which means $g_{upper}(a,n)$ is the half-exponential function. Are there other natural sequence of function candidates $h(k,n)$ (not of form form $f(k+1,a',n)$ where $a'\\in(a,1)$ ) with $$f(k+1,a,n)\\ll h(k,n)\\ll f(k,a,n)$$ $$h(k,h(k,n))=2^{O(n)}$$ at every fixed $k\\in\\mathbb Z\\cap[1,\\infty]$ ? real-analysis asymptotics special-functions limits-and-convergence growth-rate Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 29, 2020 at 23:20 asked Jun 28, 2020 at 15:51 VS. 1,846 1 1 gold badge 12 12 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ +1 interesting question.
