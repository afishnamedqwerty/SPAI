It's not hard to show that such a map is of the form $f(x) = |x|g(x/|x|)$ for some isometric immersion $g:S^2\\to S^3$, and there are many such isometric immersions $g$, especially if one only requires that $g$ be $C^1$. It is easy to write down $C^1$ examples that are smooth except at two points in $S^2$, but it is not obvious to me whether there is an example that is $C^2$ everywhere on $S^2$ other than the obvious totally geodesic isometric immersions. I imagine that this is known, but I don't recall a reference. $\\endgroup$ Robert Bryant –  Robert Bryant 2020-06-28 18:26:08 +00:00 Commented Jun 28, 2020 at 18:26 $\\begingroup$ Interesting. I guess the argument in the paper 'Isometric immersions of constant curvature manifolds' by Ferus uses only $C^2$. $\\endgroup$ SubGeo –  SubGeo 2020-06-28 18:39:41 +00:00 Commented Jun 28, 2020 at 18:39 $\\begingroup$ I don't know Ferus' paper. I guess you mean that Ferus assumes that the mapping is at least $C^2$. What conclusion does he draw from this? $\\endgroup$ Robert Bryant –  Robert Bryant 2020-06-28 20:30:47 +00:00 Commented Jun 28, 2020 at 20:30 $\\begingroup$ @RobertBryant: Exactly. He shows that every isometric immersion of $\\mathbb{S}^n$ into $\\mathbb{S}^{2n-1}$ is totally geodesic. $\\endgroup$ SubGeo –  SubGeo 2020-06-29 16:04:04 +00:00 Commented Jun 29, 2020 at 16:04 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
