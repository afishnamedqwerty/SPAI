  "title": "ac.commutative algebra - Non-zero divisors on an $I$-completely flat module",
  "body": "Let $A$ be a commutative ring (not necessarily Noetherian), $I=(f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_n) \\subseteq A$ a finitely generated ideal that is generated by a regular sequence. Let $M$ be an $A$ -module, and assume that both $M$ and $A$ are $I$ -adically complete. Finally, suppose further that $M$ is $I$ -completely flat (sometimes also called $I$ -adically flat), meaning that $\\mathrm{Tor}_{>0}^{A}(A/I, M)=0$ and $M/IM$ is a flat $A/I$ -module. My question is If $x \\in A$ is a non-zero divisor of $A$ , is $x$ necessarily a non-zero divisor on $M$ ? This seems true at least under some further assumptions on $x$ , such as $xA \\cap I^k=xI^k$ for all $k$ , but I am actually interested in the somewhat perpendicular case when $x \\in I$ , or better yet, the general question whether such $I$ -completely flat modules are torsion-free. (The claim is also true for $x=f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_n$ I believe.) Some details: One can look at the exact sequences $$0 \\rightarrow K_n/I^n \\rightarrow A/I^n \\stackrel{x}{\\rightarrow} A/I^n $$ where $K_n=(I^n: x)$ . Taking $\\varprojlim_n,$ from the fact that $x$ is a non-zero divisor on $A$ it follows that $\\varprojlim_n K_n/I^n=0$ . It can be shown that the $I$ -complete flatness is equivalent to $I^n$ -complete flatness. Thus, applying $-\\otimes_AM=-\\otimes_{A/I^n}M/I^nM$ to the above exact sequence, the sequence $$0 \\rightarrow K_nM/I^nM \\rightarrow M/I^nM \\stackrel{x}{\\rightarrow} M/I^nM$$ remains exact, and again, taking $\\varprojlim_n$ one obtains that $M[x]=\\varprojlim_n K_nM/I^nM$ . So the question is, is $\\varprojlim_nK_n/I^n=0$ enough to guarantee $\\varprojlim_nK_nM/I^nM =0$ in this situation? ac.commutative-algebra homological-algebra Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 16, 2020 at 2:24 asked Jul 11, 2020 at 22:40 Pavel Čoupek 1,127 1 1 gold badge 7 7 silver badges 15 15 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
