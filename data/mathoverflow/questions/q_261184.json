  "body": "Let $d\\in\\mathbb N$ $\\Lambda\\subseteq\\mathbb R^d$ be bounded and open $f\\in L^2(\\Lambda,\\mathbb R^d)$ $u\\in H_0^1(\\Lambda,\\mathbb R^d)$ with $$-\\langle\\nabla\\phi,\\nabla u\\rangle_{L^2(\\Lambda,\\:\\mathbb R^d)}=\\langle\\phi,f\\rangle_{L^2(\\Lambda)}\\;\\;\\;\\text{for all }\\phi\\in C_c^\\infty(\\Lambda)\\tag1$$ It's well-known (see, for example, [1]) that if $\\partial\\Lambda\\in C^2$ , then $u\\in H^2(\\Lambda)$ . Moreover (see [2]), if $d=2$ and $\\partial\\Lambda$ is \"polygonal\", we obtain $u\\in H^2(\\Lambda)$ as well. Now I'm interested in the case where $\\Lambda$ is (bounded, open and) connected and $\\partial\\Lambda$ is Lipschitz. It's fine for me, if we additionally assume that $d\\le 3$ . However, I doubt that these assumptions suffice to conclude. So, if that's indeed the case, is there any chance to show $u\\in H^2(\\Lambda)$ , if we assume that $\\Lambda$ is a polyhedron ?

Is the theorem applicable for $Au:=\\Delta u$, $u\\in\\mathcal D(A):=\\left\\{u\\in H_0^1(\\Lambda):u\\text{ admits a weak Laplacian }\\Delta u\\in L^2(\\Lambda)\\right\\}$, and $\\Lambda$ being just bounded, convex and open (without any assumption on the boundary)? $\\endgroup$ 0xbadf00d –  0xbadf00d 2017-02-03 15:58:37 +00:00 Commented Feb 3, 2017 at 15:58 $\\begingroup$ use seperation of variables on a cone in $R^2$ with opening $ \\alpha>0$ to look for harmonic functions in the cone which have zero Dirichlet BC. Probably when $ \\pi< \\alpha < 2 \\pi$ i would assume the resulting solution is not in $H^2$ in any neighborhood of the vertex. $\\endgroup$ Math604 –  Math604 2017-02-04 06:17:00 +00:00 Commented Feb 4, 2017 at 6:17 1 $\\begingroup$ @0xbadf00d take a look at the book: condition (3,1,3,1) states that $A$ has to be uniformly elliptic, so yes, $\\Delta$ will do. And no, there are no further assumptions on $\\partial \\Omega$. However, it is known that convexity is essential, even in dimension $d=2$, so I would guess tip on failure of boundary regularity for equations on non-convex polyhedra. $\\endgroup$ Delio Mugnolo –  Delio Mugnolo 2017-02-04 20:30:32 +00:00 Commented Feb 4, 2017 at 20:30 $\\begingroup$ @DelioMugnolo Do you know if the same can be shown in the case $d=3$ for the Stokes problem? I know that it's true for $d=2$ . I've asked for that in a separate question . $\\endgroup$ 0xbadf00d –  0xbadf00d 2017-03-06 16:50:38 +00:00 Commented Mar 6, 2017 at 16:50  |  Show 1 more comment 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
