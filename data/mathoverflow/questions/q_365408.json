  "body": "Let $B_t$ be a Brownian motion, with with density function $f(t,x)dx = P(B_t \\in dx)$ . Then $f$ solves the heat equation $\\partial_t = \\frac{1}{2} \\partial_{xx}f(t,x)$ . Let for a fixed $u > 0$ , $\\bar{B}_t = \\sup_{s \\leq t}B_s$ , and let $$q(t,x)dx = P( \\bar{B}_t > u, B_t \\in dx).$$ Then $q$ still solves the heat equation with initial condition $q(0,x) = 0$ for $x < u$ and boundary condition $q(t,u) = p(t,u)$ , $t \\geq 0$ . Using the classical theory of heat equation, one can write down an explicit expression for $q$ : $$ q(t,x) = \\int_0^t f(s,u) \\partial_x f(t-s,x-u)ds. \\label{1}\\tag{1} $$ Show that $q$ can also be written as $$ \\begin{align} q(t,x) &= \\int_0^t f(t-s,x-u) \\partial_u f(s,u)ds \\label{2}\\tag{2} \\\\ &= \\int_0^t f(t-s,x-u) \\frac{u}{s}f(s,u) ds. \\label{3}\\tag{3} \\end{align} $$ I can think of a heuristic probabilistic argument involving path reversal of Brownian motion. Is there an analytic way to go from expression \\eqref{1} to \\eqref{2} and \\eqref{3}? I can see that the expression \\eqref{2}/\\eqref{3} satisfies the heat equation, but haven't been able to show that it satisfies the boundary condition. That may be sufficient. brownian-motion heat-equation Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 11, 2020 at 15:38 Daniele Tampieri 6,948 10 10 gold badges 35 35 silver badges 50 50 bronze badges asked Jul 11, 2020 at 14:54 bm76 103 9 9 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 1 $\\begingroup$ @DanieleTampieri thanks for the edit :-) $\\endgroup$ bm76 –  bm76 2020-07-11 15:40:15 +00:00 Commented Jul 11, 2020 at 15:40 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
