Approximately how many integers in $a\\in[0,t]$ are there such that $a^2-1$ is $k$ -smooth? nt.number-theory smoothness Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 5, 2020 at 23:58 VS. 1,846 1 1 gold badge 12 12 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 1 $\\begingroup$ The numbers of $prime(i)$-smooth $4n^2-1$'s for $n \\le 10^6$ start $0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 15, 22, 35, 56, 76$ (i.e. there is one $3$-smooth, namely $n=1$, there are three $5$-smooth (including $n=2$ and $13$), etc).

Presumably the proof of that theorem adapts to numbers separated by 2 rather than 1. $\\endgroup$ Terry Tao –  Terry Tao 2020-07-06 03:46:43 +00:00 Commented Jul 6, 2020 at 3:46 2 $\\begingroup$ There is a PDF of Klazar from 2010 on this topic, which covers the case of smooth numbers differing by 2.
