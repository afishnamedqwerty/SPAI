  "body": "I have a confusion regarding a calculation given below : $$ \\begin{split} \\int_M C^{ij}\\nabla_i f \\nabla_j f d\\mu & = \\frac{1}{3}\\int_M g^{ij}g_{ij} C^{ij}\\nabla_i f \\nabla_j f d\\mu \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{3}\\int_M g_{ij}C^{ij}g^{ij}\\nabla_i f \\nabla_j f d\\mu \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{3}\\int_M g_{ij}C^{ij}|\\nabla f|^2 d\\mu =0 \\end{split} $$ since the Cotton tensor is traceless. This is done in dimensions three. I think this calculation is erroneous. Can we insert $g^{ij}g_{ij} $ inside? riemannian-geometry geometric-analysis Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 17, 2020 at 9:53 Carlo Beenakker 203k 19 19 gold badges 491 491 silver badges 711 711 bronze badges asked Jul 17, 2020 at 7:29 debabrata chakraborty 160 9 9 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ In its current form the formulas are at best ambiguous. Perhaps you should write everything out explicitly without using any summation conventions. $\\endgroup$ Deane Yang –  Deane Yang 2020-07-17 17:23:55 +00:00 Commented Jul 17, 2020 at 17:23 $\\begingroup$ In fact, you are misusing the summation convention. You are using the $ij$-pair twice and then cross-binding them incorrectly. The first term on the righthand side under the integral would be more correctly written as $g^{kl}g_{kl}C^{ij}\\nabla_if\\nabla_jf$, but then in the next line you using it as though it were $g^{kl}g_{ij}C^{ij}\\nabla_kf\\nabla_lf$, but it is clear that these two quantities are not at all the same. Re-using indices that are already bound in a summation is a misuse of the summation convention, and it can easily lead (as it does here) to incorrect formulae. $\\endgroup$ Robert Bryant –  Robert Bryant 2020-07-23 16:12:08 +00:00 Commented Jul 23, 2020 at 16:12 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
