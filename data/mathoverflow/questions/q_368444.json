  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - Existence of model of morphism and good reduction",
  "body": "In this question someone help me to understand why there is not always a model for a morphism $\\mathbb{P}^1_K\\to\\mathbb{P}^1_K$ . He says to me that the existence of model is equivalent of good reduction. Now I would like to understand this sentence ie take the \"good\" definitions and find a proof. Let $K$ be a local field, of integer $\\mathcal{O}$ and uniformizer $\\pi$ . Take $\\varphi:\\mathbb{P}^1_K\\to\\mathbb{P}^1_K$ a finite morphism and $f\\in K(t)$ its associated rationnal function. I propose the following definition for model : a model of $\\varphi$ is an extension of $\\varphi$ to $\\mathbb{P}^1_\\mathcal{O}$ that is a morphism $\\Phi:\\mathbb{P}^1_\\mathcal{O}\\to\\mathbb{P}^1_\\mathcal{O}$ with $\\varphi$ the extention of scalar of $\\Phi$ to $K$ that is $\\varphi=\\Phi\\times_\\mathcal{O}\\text{Id}_K$ ie the following diagram commute, $\\require{AMScd}$ \\begin{CD} \\mathbb{P}^1_K @>{\\varphi}>> \\mathbb{P}^1_K\\\\ @VVV @VVV\\\\ \\mathbb{P}^1_\\mathcal{O} @>{\\Phi}>> \\mathbb{P}^1_\\mathcal{O} \\end{CD} I'm not sure of the \"good\" definition for good reduction , I propose: as $f\\in K(t)\\setminus K$ , $K=\\text{Frac}(\\mathcal{O})$ and $\\mathcal{O}$ is factorial, then one can write $f=P/Q$ with $P,Q\\in\\mathcal{O}[t]$ coprimes (no common irreducible divisor). Then one says that $\\varphi$ has a good reduction if $\\overline{P}$ and $\\overline{Q}$ are coprimes in $k[t]$ and the degree of $P$ and $Q$ are preserve under reduction (I take this because $\\pi t^2+1$ and $\\pi t+1$ reducing to coprimly but I don't want to tell that this is a good reduction (not finit morphism), but I don't need it in the proof below...) Question : with these definitions do we have that the existence of model is equivalent to good reduction? I have elements of proof: I think that $P,Q\\in\\mathcal{O}[t]$ will define a model if $(P,Q)=\\mathcal{O}[t]$ that is $(P,Q)\\cap\\mathcal{O}=(1)$ . In general $(P,Q)\\cap\\mathcal{O}=(\\pi^q)$ with $q\\in\\mathbb{N}$ . So there is a model if $q=0$ . If there is a model then $q=0$ ie $1\\in(P,Q)$ so reducing the Bezout relation one has $1\\in(\\overline{P},\\overline{Q})$ so $\\overline{P}$ and $\\overline{Q}$ are coprimes (but how to prove that degree is preserved, or that the reduction stay a finite morphism??) If $P$ , $Q$ are coprimes then $(\\overline{P},\\overline{Q})=1$ . Here I have a problem: I'd like to show that $(P,Q)\\cap\\mathcal{O}=(\\pi^q)$ with $q>0$ is not possible. If $(\\overline{P},\\overline{Q})\\cap k=(\\overline{\\pi^q})$ the conclusion comes shortly, but I have only $(\\overline{P},\\overline{Q})\\cap k\\supseteq(\\overline{\\pi^q})$ Thnaks for your help! ag.algebraic-geometry Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Aug 6, 2020 at 8:02 Gabriel Soranzo 275 1 1 silver badge 8 8 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
