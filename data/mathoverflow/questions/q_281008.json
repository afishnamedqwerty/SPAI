  "body": "Fix $m$ arbitrary values $x_1, x_2, ..., x_m$ in $[0,1]$ , and an integer $n$ . Obtain $n$ -set $S$ by drawing $n \\le m$ times randomly without replacement from $\\{1,2,..,m\\}$ . Define r.v. $X = \\sum_{i \\in S} x_i$ and $\\mu=E[X]$ . Is it the case that $$\\Pr[X \\ge \\mu + \\epsilon\\mu] ~=~ \\exp(- \\Omega(\\epsilon^2 \\mu))~?~~~~~(1)$$ Following the hint here , we can use McDiarmid's inequality to prove the weaker bound $$\\Pr[X \\ge \\mu + \\epsilon n] ~=~ \\exp(-\\Omega(\\epsilon^2 n)),~~~~~(2)$$ but this bound depends on $n$ and is weaker when $\\mu \\ll n$ . A related but different question was asked here . [ EDIT : My original question asked first if bound (1) holds in all applications of of McDiarmid's inequality where $X=f(y_1,..,y_n)$ is a function of $n$ independent random variables, and $f$ changes by at most 1 when any $x_i$ is changed. For the record, the answer to that seems to be NO. For a counter-example, take $$\\textstyle X = f(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n) = \\big|k \\,-\\, \\big((\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i) \\bmod 2k\\big)\\big| $$ where each $x_i$ is i.i.d. uniformly over $[0,1]$ and, say, $k=\\lceil \\sqrt n\\rceil$ . Then $X$ is roughly uniformly distributed over $[0,k]$ , so $\\mu \\approx k/2$ , and $\\Pr[X \\ge \\mu + \\mu/2] = \\Omega(1) \\ne \\exp(-\\Omega(\\mu))$ .] pr.probability measure-concentration Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Sep 12, 2017 at 22:34 Neal Young 193 8 8 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 $\\begingroup$ It seems to me that multiplicative or additive are the same, of the form $\\mathbb{P}(X \\geqslant \\mu + A)$ with $ A = \\varepsilon n $ in one case and $ A = \\varepsilon \\mu $ in the other case (the wikipedia link states that this is for all $ A > 0$). If you want to state the MacDiarmid inequality in a multiplicative form, replace the $A$ accordingly in the second case, i.e. take $ \\mu t = \\varepsilon k $ and the bound in $ \\exp(-\\varepsilon^2 k/3) $ becomes $ \\exp( - ( \\mu t / k )^2 k/3) = \\exp( - t^2 \\mu^2/(3 k) ) $ (hence $c = 3k/\\mu $). Of course, $c$ depends of $ \\mu $ here... $\\endgroup$ Synia –  Synia 2017-09-13 18:53:13 +00:00 Commented Sep 13, 2017 at 18:53 $\\begingroup$ @Synia, In the form stated on Wikipedia, the bound is $$\\Pr[X \\ge \\mu + A] \\le \\exp(-A^2/n),$$ where $n$ is the number of random variables. So, (in the general case) if you substitute $A=\\epsilon\\mu$, the bound is $\\exp(-\\epsilon^2 \\mu^2/n)$, not $\\exp(-\\epsilon^2 \\mu)$. (And note that, likewise, in the application above we want $c$ to be a constant independent of $k$ and $\\mu$, e.g. $c=3$.) Also, if you look at the proof of McDiarmid, the Doob martingale that it uses can either increase or decrease in each step, which forces the use of an additive error bound. $\\endgroup$ Neal Young –  Neal Young 2017-09-13 21:07:53 +00:00 Commented Sep 13, 2017 at 21:07 $\\begingroup$ Yes, I was suspecting something like that, namely that $c $ be independent of $n $ (no need to edit, I guess). Stated like this, the question becomes of course much more interesting. There may be some inequalities available in the literature in the case of a sum that \"beat\" the classical MacDiarmid inequality (I am thinking of Chatterjee's method with exchangeable pairs). I will try to look it up. $\\endgroup$ Synia –  Synia 2017-09-13 21:44:27 +00:00 Commented Sep 13, 2017 at 21:44 $\\begingroup$ I realized that the answer to the first general question I asked is NO. I've edited the post to reflect this. $\\endgroup$ Neal Young –  Neal Young 2017-09-13 22:14:38 +00:00 Commented Sep 13, 2017 at 22:14 1 $\\begingroup$ Looks likely that the answer to the current question is yes, from Theorem 10 of this paper and Proposition 5 of this one . $\\endgroup$ Neal Young –  Neal Young 2017-09-14 02:37:31 +00:00 Commented Sep 14, 2017 at 2:37 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
