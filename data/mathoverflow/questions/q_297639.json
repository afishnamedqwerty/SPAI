  "body": "I'm currently working with a paper and I don't get something there. Let $A$ be a closed operator on a Banach space $X$ and $\\lambda \\in \\sigma(A)$ an isolated eigenvalue, i.e. there is a $r > 0$ with $\\sigma(A) \\cap B_r(\\lambda) = \\{\\lambda\\}$. Now one can define the spectral projection $$ \\Pi_\\lambda := \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\mathrm i} \\int_{\\gamma_s} R(z,A)\\,dz \\in \\mathcal L(X),$$ where $\\gamma_s: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb C, \\gamma_s(t) = s e^{2\\pi \\mathrm i t}$. By virtue of Cauchy's theorem this definition is invariant of $0 < s < r$. This is all clear to me. Now there is a \"semigroup\" defined in the followong manner: $$ S_\\lambda(t) := \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\mathrm i} \\int_{\\gamma_s} e^{tz}R(z,A)\\,dz.$$ Again it is clear to me that this is well-defined, $S_\\lambda(t) \\in \\mathcal L(X)$ for all $t \\geq 0$ and that $S_\\lambda(t + s) = S_\\lambda(t) S_\\lambda(s)$ holds for all $t, s \\geq 0$, due to resolvent identity, Fubini's and Cauchy's theorem. Since $e^{tz} \\to 1$ for $t \\to 0$ locally uniformly I even know that $\\Vert S_\\lambda(t) - S_\\lambda(0) \\Vert \\to 0$ for $t \\to 0$. The only thing I miss out on is that I can't get why $S_\\lambda(0) = I$ might hold, since one has clearly that $S(0) = \\Pi_\\lambda$. This is the only thing that's missing for $(S_\\lambda(t))_{t \\geq 0}$ to be a $C_0$-semigroup (actually it is even norm-continuous). So why should $(S_\\lambda(t))_{t \\geq 0}$ be a semigroup? fa.functional-analysis ap.analysis-of-pdes banach-spaces operator-theory semigroups-of-operators Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Feb 7, 2020 at 23:19 YCor 67.5k 5 5 gold badges 203 203 silver badges 301 301 bronze badges asked Apr 12, 2018 at 7:48 Yaddle 381 1 1 silver badge 11 11 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 2 $\\begingroup$ Everything you wrote is correct. There are at least two reasons why one could call $\\mathcal{S} := (S_\\lambda(t))_{t \\ge 0}$ a semigroup : (i) The notion semigroup is used differently by different authors in the literature. Sometimes an operator family $(T(t))_{t \\ge 0}$ is called a semigroup if merely $T(s+t) = T(s)T(t)$ for all $s,t \\ge 0$; (ii) since the operator family $\\mathcal{S}$ acts trivially on $\\ker \\Pi_0$, one is usually only interested in its action on the range of $\\Pi_0$, and the restriction of $\\mathcal{S}$ to this range is indeed a $C_0$-semigroup. $\\endgroup$ Jochen Glueck –  Jochen Glueck 2018-04-12 16:04:05 +00:00 Commented Apr 12, 2018 at 16:04 $\\begingroup$ Ok, that makes sense to me.
