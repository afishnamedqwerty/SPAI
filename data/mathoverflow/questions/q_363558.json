  "body": "Let $(X,\\|.\\|)$ be a separable Banach space and $\\mathcal{C}(X)$ be the collection of all nonempty, closed and convex subsets of $X$ . For any $C$ in $\\mathcal{C}(X)$ we set $$ s(x^*, C) := \\sup_{x\\in C}{\\langle x^*, x \\rangle}\\qquad;\\qquad \\|C\\| := \\sup_{x\\in C} \\|x\\| $$ to define for the set $C$ respectively its support function $s(., C)$ and radius $\\|C\\|$ . On $\\mathcal{C}(X)$ we use the following convergence : a net $\\{C_\\alpha\\}$ convergent scalarly to $C_\\infty$ in $\\mathcal{C}(X)$ if $$ \\lim_\\alpha s(x^*, C_\\alpha)=s(x^*, C_\\infty)\\qquad \\forall x^*\\in X^* $$ Can we say that the scalar convergence in $\\mathcal{C}(X)$ is topologizable ? fa.functional-analysis gn.general-topology convexity limits-and-convergence Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jun 19, 2020 at 17:59 Made 115 6 6 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 2 $\\begingroup$ Isn't it just the initial topology with respect to the functions $s(x^*,-)$? So a prebase would be given by sets of the form $\\{C\\text{ such that }s(x^*,C)\\in U\\}$ for $x\\in X^*$ and $U$ a open set of $\\overline{\\mathbb R}$. $\\endgroup$ Pierre PC –  Pierre PC 2020-06-19 18:13:30 +00:00 Commented Jun 19, 2020 at 18:13 $\\begingroup$ Do you know the Wijsman topology? $\\endgroup$ Made –  Made 2020-06-19 18:45:37 +00:00 Commented Jun 19, 2020 at 18:45 $\\begingroup$ I just read the definition on Wikipedia.
