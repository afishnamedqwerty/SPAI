We have $$\\xi_{i}=(\\lambda_1, 0, \\dots, 0) + \\cdots + (0, \\dots,0,\\lambda_n)$$ where $0, \\lambda_j\\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ . We can write $\\xi^{i}$ as $$\\xi_{i}=\\alpha_{i,1}(\\tilde{\\lambda}_1,0,\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,,0)+\\alpha_{i,2}(0,\\tilde{\\lambda}_2,0,\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,,0)+.\\,.\\,.\\,+\\sqrt{1-\\alpha_{i,1}^2-\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,-\\alpha_{i,n-1}^2}(0,\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,,0,\\tilde{\\lambda}_n).$$ We want to prove that there exist $\\alpha_0>0$ small enough and $i_1,\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,,i_{(n-1)\\times d}$ such that $$\\alpha_{i_k,l}>\\alpha_0\\qquad\\text{for}\\;k=1,\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,,(n-1)\\times d\\;\\text{and}\\; l=1,\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,n-1.$$ linear-algebra matrices eigenvector Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 29, 2020 at 22:45 vidyarthi 2,145 1 1 gold badge 17 17 silver badges 24 24 bronze badges asked Jul 28, 2020 at 20:05 yassine yassine 41 5 5 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 6 1 $\\begingroup$ What is $\\alpha_0$? As it’s currently written you can just choose any positive number smaller than the other $\\alpha$s, as long as they are nonzero. $\\endgroup$ Zach Teitler –  Zach Teitler 2020-07-29 15:24:18 +00:00 Commented Jul 29, 2020 at 15:24 $\\begingroup$ What is a square $n \\times d$ matrix?

They're using $\\times$ to mean multiplication, not separation of matrix dimensions. $\\endgroup$ Nathaniel Johnston –  Nathaniel Johnston 2020-07-29 23:10:50 +00:00 Commented Jul 29, 2020 at 23:10 $\\begingroup$ (To be fair, there was an explanation that the confusing terminology \"square $n \\times d$ matrix\" meant $n \\times d$ rows and $n \\times d$ columns, but, for some reason, @vidyarthi edited it out.) $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-07-30 00:39:15 +00:00 Commented Jul 30, 2020 at 0:39 $\\begingroup$ The $+$ signs mean $\\oplus$, right? (Else the lengths of the vectors don't match.)
