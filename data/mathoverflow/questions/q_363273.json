  "body": "Suppose I have $n$ sets of $k$ balls each, with each one of the $nk$ balls distributed uniformly at random among $m$ bins. Further suppose that I have a probability vector $p=(p_1,\\dots,p_m)$ . I am interested in selecting one ball from each of the $n$ sets, such that each bin $i$ contains roughly $p_i n$ selected balls. Is there an asymptotic expression for the number of ways this can be done, in the limit as $n\\to\\infty$ ? co.combinatorics pr.probability enumerative-combinatorics Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 16, 2020 at 21:45 asked Jun 16, 2020 at 21:05 Tom Solberg 4,131 13 13 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 $\\begingroup$ So you distribute the $nk$ balls and then try to select one per set to match $p$? $\\endgroup$ Brian Hopkins –  Brian Hopkins 2020-06-16 22:21:33 +00:00 Commented Jun 16, 2020 at 22:21 $\\begingroup$ @BrianHopkins yes, correct. $\\endgroup$ Tom Solberg –  Tom Solberg 2020-06-16 22:22:33 +00:00 Commented Jun 16, 2020 at 22:22 $\\begingroup$ How do the other quantities depend on $n$?
