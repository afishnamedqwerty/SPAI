  "body": "The Green function $G(x,y) =G(x-y)$ of the discrete Klein-Gordon operator $-\\Delta+p$ on $\\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ is given by: \\begin{eqnarray} G(x-y) = \\int_{[-\\pi,\\pi]^{d}}\\frac{d^{d}k}{(2\\pi)^{d}}\\frac{e^{ik\\cdot (x-y)}}{\\gamma(k)+p} \\quad (x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d}) \\label{1}\\tag{1} \\end{eqnarray} where $p>0$ , $k\\cdot (x-y) := k_{1}(x_{1}-y_{1}) +\\cdots+k_{d}(x_{d}-y_{d})$ and: $$\\gamma(k) := 2\\sum_{j=1}^{d}(1-\\cos(k_{j})). $$ Now, I think I've read somewhere (I don't seem to recall what was the article, sadly) that this function has exponential decay, i.e: \\begin{eqnarray} G(x-y) \\le Ke^{\\alpha ||x-y||_{\\infty}} \\tag{2}\\label{2} \\end{eqnarray} where $\\alpha$ and $K$ are positive constants and $||x-y||_{\\infty} := \\text{max}\\{|x_{1}-y_{1}|,...,|x_{d}-y_{d}|\\}$ . I'm trying by myself to prove this result (and I don't think it is very difficult) but my first couple attempts were unsuccessfull. I've tried math stack and nobody helped me either, so I'm starting to doubt my memory and I don't know if this estimate holds. So my question is: does (\\ref{2}) hold and, if so, how can I prove it? co.combinatorics estimation-theory green-function Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 8, 2020 at 22:36 asked Jul 8, 2020 at 20:31 MathMath 1,465 9 9 silver badges 21 21 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 6 1 $\\begingroup$ you need $p>0$ for the decay. $\\endgroup$ Abdelmalek Abdesselam –  Abdelmalek Abdesselam 2020-07-08 21:02:49 +00:00 Commented Jul 8, 2020 at 21:02 $\\begingroup$ Oh, right!

Try it for $d=1$ first assuming WLOG $x-y>0$, and try to create a positive imaginary part in $k$. For higher $d$ you can iterate by adding the cosine expressions of the previous components of $k$ to the mass $p$. BTW finding exact long distance asymptotics is nontrivial. $\\endgroup$ Abdelmalek Abdesselam –  Abdelmalek Abdesselam 2020-07-08 22:49:52 +00:00 Commented Jul 8, 2020 at 22:49 $\\begingroup$ Do you know any reference on this second approach? $\\endgroup$ MathMath –  MathMath 2020-07-08 22:55:37 +00:00 Commented Jul 8, 2020 at 22:55  |  Show 1 more comment 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
