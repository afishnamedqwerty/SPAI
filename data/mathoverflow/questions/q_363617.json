  "title": "stochastic calculus - Ito&#39;s Lemma (CVF) on product of Poisson processes",
  "body": "I have the following stochastic differential equation: $da(t)=\\{r(t)a(t)+w(t)−pc(t)\\}dt+βa(t)dq(t)$ , with $q(t)$ a Poisson process with arrival rate $λ$ and its increment $dq(t)$ is denoted by: $dq(t)=0$ with probability $1−λdt$ $dq(t)=1$ with probability $λdt$ I know that using the Change of Variable formula (CVF) (=Ito's Lemma on Poisson processes), we can write the differential $dV(a(t))$ as: $dV(a)=V'(a)\\{ra+w−pc\\}dt+\\{V(a+βa)−V(a)\\}dq$ with $V'(a)$ the differential of $V$ with respect to $a$ . Now, if I modify the initial SDE and write it: $da(t)=\\{r(t)a(t)+w(t)−pc(t)\\}dt+βa(t)dq(t)+γa(t)dq_tdq^i_t$ with $dq^i(t)$ the increment of a Poisson process $q^i_t$ similar to the previous one: $dq^i(t)=0$ with probability $1−λ^idt$ $dq^i(t)=1$ with probability $λ^idt$ What would be the result of applying the the CVF on that new SDE? Replacing $dq_tdq^i_t$ by a process $dQ$ , $dQ(t)=0$ with probability $1−λλ^idt^2$ $dQ(t)=1$ with probability $λλ^idt^2$ I would say: $dV(a)=V′(a)\\{ra+w−pc\\}dt+\\{V(a+βa)−V(a)\\}dq+\\{V(a+γa)−V(a)\\}dQ$ .
