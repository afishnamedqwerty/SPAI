  "body": "For a graph $G=(V,E)$ , is there a standard notation for the induced subgraph on $V \\setminus \\{v,w\\}$ where $v,w$ are the endpoints of some edge $e$ ? I know $G[V \\setminus \\{v,w\\}]$ is an option, but I’m looking for something more compact. $G \\setminus e$ is used for deletion and $G/e$ is used for contraction, so I’m inclined to use $G-e$ , but perhaps that already has another meaning. graph-theory notation Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jun 28, 2020 at 23:00 James Propp 20.2k 5 5 gold badges 58 58 silver badges 147 147 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 1 $\\begingroup$ Isn't $G-e$ used for the spanning subgraph where only the edge is deleted and the vertices remain?

And then $G-S$ is equally well defined for any set $S$ of vertices. $\\endgroup$ M. Winter –  M.
