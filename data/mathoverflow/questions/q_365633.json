  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - Picard scheme of family of quartic surfaces",
  "body": "Recall that a quartic surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3_\\mathbb{C}$ has $N = 35$ coefficients. Let $U$ be the open subset of $\\mathbb{P}^{N-1}$ parametrising smooth quartic surfaces and let $Q \\to U$ be the corresponding family of all smooth quartic surfaces. Let $Pic_{Q/U}$ denote the Picard scheme of this family. What is $Pic_{Q/U}$ ? Picard groups of quartic surfaces can behave quite erratically, but my guess is that $Pic_{Q/U} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ is a constant group scheme, generated by $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ . It would be nice to have confirmation of this, ideally with a proof. ag.algebraic-geometry picard-group Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 14, 2020 at 19:43 Daniel Loughran 22.4k 3 3 gold badges 55 55 silver badges 146 146 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 2 $\\begingroup$ Formation of the Picard scheme commutes with base change, so the fibers of $Pic_{Q/U} \\to U$ are complicated. $\\endgroup$ Angelo –  Angelo 2020-07-14 19:56:34 +00:00 Commented Jul 14, 2020 at 19:56 $\\begingroup$ Thanks this makes sense. Still, I'm struggling to come up with a flat map $V \\to U$ with $V$ connected such that $Pic_{Q/U}(V) \\neq \\mathbb{Z}$, since the genetic quartic surface has Picard group $\\mathbb{Z}$. $\\endgroup$ Daniel Loughran –  Daniel Loughran 2020-07-14 20:32:45 +00:00 Commented Jul 14, 2020 at 20:32 2 $\\begingroup$ There is no such flat map; the special fibers of $Pic_{Q/U} \\to U$ are concentrated on proper subvarieties of $U$. $\\endgroup$ Angelo –  Angelo 2020-07-15 10:20:54 +00:00 Commented Jul 15, 2020 at 10:20 $\\begingroup$ Yes I finally get it now.
