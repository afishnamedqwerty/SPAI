  "title": "sg.symplectic geometry - Symplectic reduction and canonical one form",
  "body": "Let $X$ be a smooth manifold. Then $T^*X$ is canonically a symplectic manifold. Let $\\alpha$ denote the canonical one form on $T^*X$ (so in local coordinates, $\\alpha=\\sum p_i dq_i$). Then the symplectic form is given by $\\beta=d\\alpha$. Now suppose we have a free proper action of a Lie group $G$ on $X$. Then we get a Hamiltonian action of $G$ on $T^*X$ and the quotient $Y=(T^*X)/G$ is canonically a Poisson manifold. Thus, we have a $2$-vector $\\psi\\in H^0(Y, \\wedge^2 TM)$ satisfying an appropriate integrability condition. Question 1: How do we describe $\\psi$ in terms of $\\alpha$? Next, let C be a symplectic leaf of $Y$. Let $\\gamma=\\gamma_C$ denote the symplectic form on $C$. Question 2: How do we describe $\\gamma$ in terms of $\\alpha$? sg.symplectic-geometry poisson-geometry Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 12, 2018 at 7:42 Alex M. 5,517 11 11 gold badges 39 39 silver badges 56 56 bronze badges asked Mar 26, 2017 at 5:34 Dr. Evil 3,003 1 1 gold badge 18 18 silver badges 30 30 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
