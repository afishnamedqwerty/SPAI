  "title": "reference request - Maximal order of $x^n-d$ and its dependence on $d$",
  "body": "It's well known that the structure of the maximal order of $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{d}]$ depends on $d$ modulo $4$ : (assuming $d$ is squarefree), the maximal order is $\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\right]$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\mod{4}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ otherwise. The structure of the biquadratic extension $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{d},\\sqrt{e}]$ has a similar but more complicated description. Now let's consider $K=\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[n]{d}]$ . For simplicity, let's consider only $d$ prime. Based on some SAGE computation, it seems that there is a degree $n$ extension $M$ of $\\mathbb{Q}[\\mu_{n^2}]$ such that $\\mathcal{O}_K$ contains more than just $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt[n]{d}]$ iff $d$ splits in $M$ . (Note that if $n$ is prime, then $M$ is unique.) For $n=2$ , one sees that $M=\\mathbb{Q}[i]$ . Is this known? It doesn't seem too hard to prove that if $d$ is split, then there are more algebraic integers in $K$ . But does this appear anywhere? reference-request algebraic-number-theory class-field-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 22, 2020 at 0:59 David Corwin 16k 11 11 gold badges 89 89 silver badges 128 128 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 2 $\\begingroup$ You are asking when the ring of integers of $\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt[n]{d})$ is $\\mathbf Z[\\sqrt[n]{d}]$. Presumably you intend for $x^n - d$ to be irreducible (before you take $d$ prime for simplicity). See the theorems in kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/gradnumthy/integersradical.pdf . You might also be interested in arxiv.org/abs/1909.07184 , although it is about a setting over a base ring larger than $\\mathbf Z$. $\\endgroup$ KConrad –  KConrad 2020-07-22 02:46:51 +00:00 Commented Jul 22, 2020 at 2:46 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
