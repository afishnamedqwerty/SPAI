  "body": "Given $$ C = AFA^T + A\\bar{F} $$ where $A = [A_1 A_2]$ , $F = \\begin{bmatrix} F_1 & F_2 \\\\ F_2^T & F_3 \\end{bmatrix}$ , $\\bar{F} = 2 \\begin{bmatrix} \\bar{F}_1 \\\\ \\bar{F}_2 \\end{bmatrix}$ such that $A_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}, F_i = F_i^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times k}, \\bar{F}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times n}$ and further $F_i, C = C^T \\succeq 0$ . Is it possible to represent $C \\succeq 0$ in the following compact-quadratic form: $$ C = A_M F_M A_M^T $$ for some $A_M$ with $F_M = F_M^T \\succeq 0$ ? linear-algebra matrices Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 10, 2020 at 1:16 asked Aug 9, 2020 at 20:02 P Emt 1 1 1 bronze badge $\\endgroup$ 5 $\\begingroup$ Why are you using F for two different matrices? $\\endgroup$ kodlu –  kodlu 2020-08-10 00:31:18 +00:00 Commented Aug 10, 2020 at 0:31 $\\begingroup$ Do you have a requirement that you do not want to \"mix\" $A$ and $F$ terms? Otherwise that is trivially true; every $C \\succeq 0$ can be written as $BB^T$ for some $B$. $\\endgroup$ Federico Poloni –  Federico Poloni 2020-08-10 07:04:08 +00:00 Commented Aug 10, 2020 at 7:04 $\\begingroup$ @FedericoPoloni hi - yes, I need to keep the $A, F$ terms separate. he closest i came across was a DT Lyapunov eqn here en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_equation but of course I have an 𝐹¯ sitting in the second term so am not sure ... i just needed a way to combine the second piece into the first one so was thinking if the second-linear term could be re-written as a quadratic in 𝐴 somehow via sq. root etc but couldn't arrive at a firm concl. also, $k \\leq n$. $\\endgroup$ P Emt –  P Emt 2020-08-10 14:51:45 +00:00 Commented Aug 10, 2020 at 14:51 $\\begingroup$ Then I would suggest that you edit your requirements in the question. Your form for $C$ can only produce terms of the form $(A_M)_{ij}(F_M)_{jk}(A_M)_{lk}$, so if you want to have a term not in this form you will have to include some nonzero constants inside $A$... $\\endgroup$ Federico Poloni –  Federico Poloni 2020-08-10 15:43:25 +00:00 Commented Aug 10, 2020 at 15:43 $\\begingroup$ thank you - i am totally open to any additions to the $A, F, \\bar{F}$ matrices once I can collapse these into the quadratic expression. Would appreciate any assistance with this. $\\endgroup$ P Emt –  P Emt 2020-08-10 17:15:45 +00:00 Commented Aug 10, 2020 at 17:15 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
