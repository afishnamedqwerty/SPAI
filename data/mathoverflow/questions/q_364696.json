  "title": "gt.geometric topology - Embedded surfaces in pseudo-Anosov mapping tori",
  "body": "Given a genus $g$ (where $g \\geq 2$ ) closed surface $S$ , and a pseudo-Anosov map $\\varphi: S \\to S$ , one can construct the mapping torus, which turns out to be a hyperbolic $3$ -manifold, which we'll call $M$ . Inside $M$ , one way to construct other closed embedded surfaces is via the following construction: Take a (multi-)curve $\\gamma$ in $S$ such that $\\varphi(\\gamma)$ is disjoint from $\\gamma$ . (Post comment edit) The curves $\\gamma$ and $\\varphi(\\gamma)$ bound a subsurface $S'$ with two boundary components, namely $\\gamma$ and $\\varphi(\\gamma)$ . Take the union (in $M$ ) of $S'$ (where we think of $S'$ as the subsurface of the fiber over the point $0 \\in S^1$ ) and $f_{[0,1]}(\\gamma)$ , where $f$ is the suspension flow of $\\varphi$ . Questions : Is every embedded surface in $M$ homologous to a surface obtained via the above construction? If the answer to the above question is no, does the answer become yes if we are allowed to change the monodromy map $\\varphi$ and the fiber $S$ , while keeping the total space $M$ fixed? P.S. I'm new to $3$ -manifold topology, and thus am not sure if the construction I described has a well-known name already. If it does, someone could perhaps point that out in the comments, and I can edit this question accordingly. EDIT: I realize that it might not be possible to realize surfaces of very high genus via this construction, since there might not be enough room on $S$ , so maybe the question should be what are the surfaces that can be realized this way. gt.geometric-topology 3-manifolds mapping-class-groups Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 3, 2020 at 16:04 asked Jul 2, 2020 at 21:16 sayantankhan 289 1 1 silver badge 7 7 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 $\\begingroup$ That union, which I'll call $K$, is not a surface. Up to homeomorphism, $K$ is the quotient of the union of $S$ with $S^1 \\times[0,1]$ where $S^1 \\times 0$ is identified with $\\gamma$ and $S^1 \\times 1$ is identified with $\\phi(\\gamma)$. The topological space $K$ is not a 2-manifold near any point $x \\in \\gamma \\cup \\phi(\\gamma)$, because the relative homology group $H_2(K,K-x;\\mathbb Z)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb Z^2$, not to $\\mathbb Z$ as is required to be a 2-manifold. Intuitively, instead of just 2 surface sheets meeting near $x$, there are 3 of them. $\\endgroup$ Lee Mosher –  Lee Mosher 2020-07-03 14:16:50 +00:00 Commented Jul 3, 2020 at 14:16 $\\begingroup$ Yes, of course. I forgot to write down a step in the construction where I look at a subsurface $S'$ whose two boundary components are $\\gamma$ and $\\varphi(\\gamma)$. That leads to the result space being a manifold with two boundary components, with a cylinder glued together to the two boundary components, which definitely is a surface $\\endgroup$ sayantankhan –  sayantankhan 2020-07-03 16:00:45 +00:00 Commented Jul 3, 2020 at 16:00 2 $\\begingroup$ The surfaces you describe here are sometimes called \"cut and cross-join surfaces\". I believe they were first introduced in: Cooper, Long & Reid, Bundles and finite foliations. Invent. Math. 118 (1994), no. 2, 255–283, and further developed in Masters, Thick surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Geom. Dedicata 119 (2006), 17–33. $\\endgroup$ HJRW –  HJRW 2020-07-05 16:05:49 +00:00 Commented Jul 5, 2020 at 16:05 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
