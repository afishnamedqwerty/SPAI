  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - A morphism $F$ of algebraic stacks is quasi-compact iff $|F|$ is quasi-compact",
  "body": "This is 5.6.3. of Laumon, Moret-Bailly's \"Champs Algeriques\". Let $S$ be a scheme, $\\mathscr{X, Y}$ algebraic stacks over $S$ , and $F : \\mathscr{X \\to Y}$ a morphism. Then $F$ is quasi-compact (i.e., for every quasi-compact scheme $Y$ and every $Y \\to \\mathscr{Y}$ , the stack $\\mathscr{X} \\times_\\mathscr{Y} Y$ is quasi-compact) iff $|F|$ is quasi-compact. ( $|F|$ is the canonical continuous map of topological spaces $|\\mathscr{X}| \\to |\\mathscr{Y}|$ .) In this text, the authors assume that $S$ is quasi-separated and that all algebraic stacks are quasi-separated over the base scheme. But I want to show this highlighted statement for non-qs base schemes and for non-qs algebraic stacks. In the proof of \"if\" part, the authors says that, for quasi-compact algebraic stack $\\mathscr{X, Y}$ and a morphism $F : \\mathscr{X \\to Y}$ , $F$ is quasi-compact. I think that this needs the quasi-separation of $S$ and $\\mathscr{Y}$ . Taking a look at the Stacks Project, I couldn't find its references. Is this holds for non qs stacks? If so, how can I show it? ag.algebraic-geometry algebraic-stacks Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 4, 2020 at 14:01 asked Aug 4, 2020 at 13:05 k.j. 1,364 9 9 silver badges 21 21 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ Can you remind us what $|F|$ is?
