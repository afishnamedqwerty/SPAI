  "title": "reference request - bijection mapping a transversal to a transversal",
  "body": "The following must certainly be a standard result, so what I'm looking for is a reference, or the name of this theorem. I don't have any combinatorics books at my fingertips, but I could see this being included therein. If finite sets $X$ and $Y$ are each partitioned into $n$ equal size subsets $\\{X_i\\}$ and $\\{Y_i\\}$ for $i$ from $1$ to $n$ , and $f\\colon X\\to Y$ is a bijection, there exists $x_i$ in $X_i$ and $\\sigma\\in S_n$ such that $f(x_i)\\in Y_{\\sigma(i)}$ , for $i$ from $1$ to $n$ . I was able to come up with an argument for this myself without too much difficulty, but I'd rather not include a proof of a (very likely) well known result.

Perhaps there is a typo? $\\endgroup$ François G. Dorais –  François G.

Consider then a cyclic permutation $f$ of the equivalence classes. Then $f(x_i)\\not\\in Y_i$ for each $i$. It seems you are using some unstated assumptions $\\endgroup$ David Roberts –  David Roberts ♦ 2020-07-13 01:43:35 +00:00 Commented Jul 13, 2020 at 1:43 2 $\\begingroup$ Here is a precise statement of what I think you are asking about: if $n$ is a positive integer, and if a set $S$ (not necessarily finite!) is partitioned into $n$-element sets $X_i$ $(i\\in I)$, and the same set $S$ is also partitioned into $n$-element sets $Y_j$ $(j\\in J)$, then there is a set $R\\subseteq S$ such that $|R\\cap X_i|=|R\\cap Y_j|=1$ for all $i\\in I$, $j\\in J$. Due to Philip Hall, I believe. $\\endgroup$ bof –  bof 2020-07-13 02:29:09 +00:00 Commented Jul 13, 2020 at 2:29 1 $\\begingroup$ @bof another way to think of this (at least in the finite case) is by considering the projection map $\\mathrm{pr}\\colon X\\times I \\to I$ where $X$ and $I$ are finite (note $|I|=n$, not $|X|=n$, in the question. Let $|X| = k$), and $q\\colon X\\times I \\to I$ is another function with $|q^{-1}(i)| = k$ for all $i$. Is there then, for each $i\\in I$, an $x_i\\in X$ such that $q(x_i,i) = i$? $\\endgroup$ David Roberts –  David Roberts ♦ 2020-07-13 03:16:47 +00:00 Commented Jul 13, 2020 at 3:16 2 $\\begingroup$ @TimKohl I suggest you edit the question to include your correction, otherwise it is buried in the comments. $\\endgroup$ David Roberts –  David Roberts ♦ 2020-07-13 04:18:18 +00:00 Commented Jul 13, 2020 at 4:18  |  Show 7 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
