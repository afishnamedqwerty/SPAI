  "body": "Let $P$ be an irreducible polynomial of $\\mathbb F_q[T]$ . Does it exist $s\\in\\mathbb N_0$ and $s+1$ polynomials $A_i(T)$ in $\\mathbb F_q[T]$ not all zero such that $\\lim_{n\\to+\\infty}v_P\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^sA_i(T)(T^{q^n}-T)^i\\right)=+\\infty$ ? The case $\\deg(P)=1$ is obviously true. Thanks in advance The context: None of the series $\\sum_{n\\ge0}\\frac1{(T^{q^n}-T)^i}$ ( $i\\in\\mathbb N_0$ ) converges in $\\mathbb F_q(T)_P$ , the $P$ -adic completion of $\\mathbb F_q(T)$ . So I wondered whether I could do a finite non-zero linear combinaison of these series such that the resulting series converges. nt.number-theory polynomials Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 25, 2020 at 6:47 asked Jul 25, 2020 at 5:52 joaopa 4,358 1 1 gold badge 17 17 silver badges 24 24 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ Could you give some more context? As written, $s$ has nothing to do with $n$, so just take $A_i(T) = 0$ for $i = 0, \\ldots, s$ and the result is trivially true, so there is no content is merely wanting an example. If you are trying to do something with such a set-up, it might be better to focus a question on that. $\\endgroup$ KConrad –  KConrad 2020-07-25 06:32:13 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 6:32 $\\begingroup$ Sorry. I forgot to say all not the $A_i$'s can be zero. I edit my question. $\\endgroup$ joaopa –  joaopa 2020-07-25 06:38:21 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 6:38 $\\begingroup$ What is $\\mathbf N_0$: integers that are $\\geq 0$? I don't see any point in allowing $s = 0$, so surely you want $s \\geq 1$. The context you added doesn't explain the point of your question. The context is a series running over $n$ while the question is a series running over $i$ (with a limit in $n$). Is there a typo in your initial question? $\\endgroup$ KConrad –  KConrad 2020-07-25 07:16:56 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 7:16 $\\begingroup$ A reason the series $\\sum_{n \\geq 0} 1/(T^{q^n}-T)^i$ for $i \\geq 1$ (it is pointless to even consider $i = 0$, as all terms in the series are then $1$) does not converge $P$-adically for an irreducible $P$ is that $T^{q^n}-T$ is divisible by $P$ when $n$ is divisible by $\\deg P$, so $(T^{q^n}-T)^i$ is divisible by $P^i$ when $n$ is divisible by $\\deg P$. Therefore lots of terms in the series from your context paragraph are not $P$-adically integral. I don't see the motivation for seeking a \"finite nonzero linear combination\" that makes the series converge. $\\endgroup$ KConrad –  KConrad 2020-07-25 07:19:49 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 7:19 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
