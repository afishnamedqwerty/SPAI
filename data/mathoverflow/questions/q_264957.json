  "title": "reference request - Existence of a transfinite sequence of abelian groups having a strange property",
  "body": "I am studying a paper which uses the following lemma. The context is irrelevant, as the lemma is only used as a technical trick and has no pointer to a reference or hint in the proof but its link to theory of heights in $p$ -torsion abelian groups (which I ignore). There exists a sequence $B_\\bullet = (B_\\alpha)$ of $p$ -torsion abelian groups, one for each ordinal number $\\alpha\\in \\text{Ord}$ , satisfying the following properties: each $B_\\alpha$ contains an element $x_\\alpha$ such that $p x_\\alpha = 0$ ; when $\\alpha < \\beta$ every function of sets $f_{\\alpha\\beta} \\colon B_\\alpha \\to B_\\beta$ such that $f(px)=p f(x)$ sends $x_\\alpha$ to zero. Also, I would like to know if the following refinement of the result is true. There exists a sequence $B_\\bullet = (B_\\alpha)$ of $p$ -torsion abelian groups, one for each ordinal number $\\alpha\\in \\text{Ord}$ , satisfying the following properties: each $B_\\alpha$ contains an element $x_\\alpha$ such that $p x_\\alpha = 0$ ; when $\\alpha < \\beta$ every function of sets $f_{\\alpha\\beta} \\colon B_\\alpha \\to B_\\beta$ such that $f(px)=p f(x)$ sends $x_\\alpha$ to zero. There exists B such that each $B_\\alpha$ has a map $B_\\alpha \\to B$ of groups that does not vanish on $x_\\alpha$ . I am pretty sure that function of sets is not needed, so if someone has the answer with the hypotesis morphisms of group , please don't be shy. reference-request gr.group-theory abelian-groups Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Mar 18, 2017 at 11:05 Ivan Di Liberti 9,890 1 1 gold badge 32 32 silver badges 73 73 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 7 2 $\\begingroup$ I assume from context that by $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ you mean a cyclic group of order $p$ rather than the $p$-adic integers? The refinement can't be true, since with the extra condition $B_\\alpha$ contains a cyclic direct summand of order $p$ generated by $x_\\alpha$, so there will always be a homomorphism $B_\\alpha\\to B_\\beta$ sending $x_\\alpha$ to $x_\\beta$. $\\endgroup$ Jeremy Rickard –  Jeremy Rickard 2017-03-18 11:19:16 +00:00 Commented Mar 18, 2017 at 11:19 $\\begingroup$ What if I replace $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ with any other abelian group?
