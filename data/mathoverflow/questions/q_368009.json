  "title": "real analysis - About an estimate of an oblique derivative problem of Laplace&#39;s equation",
  "body": "Suppose $n\\geq 2$ , set $B=B_r(0)\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ , $B^+=\\{x\\in B|x_n>0\\}$ , $H=\\{x\\in B|x_n=0\\}$ , Let $u\\in C^\\infty(B^+)\\cap C^1(B^+\\cup H)$ be a solution of the following oblique derivative problem: $$\\begin{cases} \\Delta u=0 & \\text{in} & B^+,\\\\ au+\\beta\\cdot\\nabla u=0 & \\text{on} & H, \\end{cases}$$ where the constant $a\\leq 0$ , $\\beta$ is a constant vector with the $n$ -th component $\\beta_n>0$ . Then $u$ can be uniquely extended to a harmoic function on $B'=B_{\\lambda r}(0)$ , where $\\lambda=\\beta_n/|\\beta|$ . In fact, let $v=au+\\beta\\cdot\\nabla u$ on $B^+\\cup H$ , and $v(x',-x_n)=-v(x',x_n)$ , then $v$ is harmonic on $B$ ; for any $x_0\\in H$ , let $$u(x_0+t\\beta)=e^{-at}(u(x_0)+\\int_0^t v(x_0+s\\beta)e^{as}ds)$$ whenever $x_0+t\\beta\\in B$ , then it's easy to check $u$ is smooth and harmonic in $B'$ , and coincides with the previous $u$ in $B'\\cap \\{x_n\\geq 0\\}$ . The question is: Does the following estimate necessarily hold, where $C$ is a positive constant independent of $u$ ? $$\\sup_{B'}|u|\\leq C\\sup_{B^+}|u|$$ I guessed it's true but could not find the answer. If it's indeed true, please give a sketch of proof, if not, I also want to see the reason. real-analysis ap.analysis-of-pdes elliptic-pde Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 31, 2020 at 16:52 asked Jul 31, 2020 at 9:03 lzcsl 11 2 2 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 $\\begingroup$ Erm... The points $x_0+t\\beta: x_0\\in H, t<0$ do not necessarily cover $B_-$, so your extension is not defined in the whole $B$, as written. $\\endgroup$ fedja –  fedja 2020-07-31 15:11:31 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 15:11 $\\begingroup$ No chance. Consider $n=2$, $\\beta=(1,1)$. Then $H=[-1,1]$, right? Now just draw the picture. What do you see? I see a slanted strip that covers some part of the unit disk, but far from the whole unit disk. $\\endgroup$ fedja –  fedja 2020-07-31 16:14:36 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 16:14 $\\begingroup$ @fedja Well, I modified the question a little, which is enough for my purposes. $\\endgroup$ lzcsl –  lzcsl 2020-07-31 16:53:11 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 16:53 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
