  "title": "fa.functional analysis - Uniform limit of m-homogeneous polynomials over compact subsets of a Banach Space",
  "body": "I am trying to solve problem 1.2.A from Mujica's book \"Complex Analysis in Banach Spaces\". We denote by $\\mathcal{P}_a(^mE;F)$ the space of all $m-$ homogeneous polynomials from $E$ into $F$ , i.e, the mappings $P:E\\longrightarrow F$ such that exists a multilinear symmetric $A:E^m \\longrightarrow F$ that satisfies: $$P(x) = Ax^m = A(x,\\ldots,x) \\quad \\forall x \\in E$$ Let $(P_j)$ a sequence in $\\mathcal{P}_a(^mE;F)$ such that the limit $P(x)=\\lim P_j(x)$ exists for every $x\\in E$ . Show that $P\\in \\mathcal{P}_a(^mE;F)$ . Show that if each $P_j$ is continuous, then $P$ is continuous as well and $(P_j)$ converges uniformly to $P$ on compact subsets of $E$ . It's easy to prove (1), and the first part of item (2) is a consequence of the Principle of Uniform Boundedness to homogeneous polynomials: Theorem: A subset of $\\mathcal{P}_a(^mE;F)$ is norm bounded if and only if it is pointwise bounded. I couldn't prove the uniform convergence over a compact subset $K\\subset E$ , can anyone help me? I will be grateful for any help you can provide. OBS: This is a crosspost. Although I asked this question in math.stackexchange.com and put a bounty for 2 weeks, I still don't have a clue how to solve it.

So you could apply that $\\sup_j \\|P_j\\|<\\infty$ and a compact set admits a finite $\\varepsilon$-net for every $\\varepsilon>0$. $\\endgroup$ M.González –  M.González 2016-03-27 08:12:31 +00:00 Commented Mar 27, 2016 at 8:12 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
