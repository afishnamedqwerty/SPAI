  "title": "dg.differential geometry - Regularity of a singular Kaehler Einstein metric",
  "body": "On a manifold $X$ of general type i.e. $X$ is projective and $c_1(K_{X})$ semiample. One can construct a singular Kaehler Einstein metric $\\omega_{\\infty}$ in $-c_1(X)$ . In particular, $\\omega_{\\infty}$ can be constructed as the limit of a normalized Kaehler Ricci flow, and in this case the potential $\\varphi$ of $\\omega_{\\infty}$ is shown to be $L^{\\infty}(X)$ . I wonder whether it is possible to say something about $|\\nabla \\varphi|$ and higher derivatives of $\\varphi$ . dg.differential-geometry ap.analysis-of-pdes kahler-manifolds Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Aug 5, 2020 at 4:54 ranzhang 21 1 1 bronze badge $\\endgroup$ 3 1 $\\begingroup$ The gradient estimate is known, cf Proposition 4.1 here arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0445.pdf . I am not aware of any higher order estimates. $\\endgroup$ Henri –  Henri 2020-08-05 07:46:40 +00:00 Commented Aug 5, 2020 at 7:46 $\\begingroup$ Thank you and that is really helpful! Also the paper measures the gradient against the KE metric but I think it can be easily checked that it is actually true for any non singular metric. $\\endgroup$ ranzhang –  ranzhang 2020-08-05 16:06:25 +00:00 Commented Aug 5, 2020 at 16:06 $\\begingroup$ no, it is crucial that the gradient be taken wrt to the KE metric (which has singularities). I see no reason why the potential should be Lipschitz. $\\endgroup$ Henri –  Henri 2020-08-05 17:43:53 +00:00 Commented Aug 5, 2020 at 17:43 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
