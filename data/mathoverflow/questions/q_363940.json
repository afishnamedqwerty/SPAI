  "body": "Let $G$ be the group $GL(n,F)$ , where $F$ is a non-archimedean local field. Is it true that for any smooth irreducible supercuspidal representation (with trivial central character) $(\\pi,V)$ of $G$ we have $$\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}Hom_{T}(\\pi,1_T)=1,$$ where $T$ is the diagonal torus of $G$ ? By Frobenuis reciprocity the result is equivalent to say that $$\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}Hom_{G}(\\pi,Ind_{T}^{G}1_{T})=1$$ Is there any reference on the subject ? rt.representation-theory p-adic-groups Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 23, 2020 at 17:40 asked Jun 23, 2020 at 17:09 Rajkarov 933 4 4 silver badges 11 11 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 2 $\\begingroup$ Certainly not if the central character of $\\pi$ is nontrivial - it will be zero instead. $\\endgroup$ Will Sawin –  Will Sawin 2020-06-23 17:25:35 +00:00 Commented Jun 23, 2020 at 17:25 $\\begingroup$ In fact, I want the result in exactly this case, that is when $\\pi$ have trivial central character. $\\endgroup$ Rajkarov –  Rajkarov 2020-06-23 17:30:07 +00:00 Commented Jun 23, 2020 at 17:30 $\\begingroup$ doi.org/10.1007/BF01445212 $\\endgroup$ Peter Humphries –  Peter Humphries 2020-06-23 23:05:28 +00:00 Commented Jun 23, 2020 at 23:05 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
