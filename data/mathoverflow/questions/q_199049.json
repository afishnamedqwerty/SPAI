  "title": "lie groups - Sections of inverse image sheaf of sheaf of sections of vector bundle",
  "body": "Let $\\eta \\colon Y \\to Z$ be holomorphic map between complex manifolds, $E$ holomorphic vector bundle over $Z$ , $\\eta ^\\ast E$ its pullback over $Y$ , ${\\cal O}_E$ sheaf of sections of $E$ , and $\\eta^{-1}{\\cal O}_E$ topological inverse image sheaf. In the book \"Penrose transform - its interaction with representation theory\" by Baston and Eastwood, on page 69. there is a claim: Sections of $\\eta^{-1}{\\cal O}_E$ are sections of bundle $\\eta ^\\ast E$ which are locally constant along fibers of $\\eta$ . There is a counterexample: Take $\\eta$ to be inclusion $\\{y\\} \\subset Z$ . Then $\\eta ^\\ast E$ is just fiber $E_y$ over $y$ , sections of bundle $\\eta ^\\ast E$ which are locally constant along fibers of $\\eta$ are just elements of $E_y$ . On the other hand, $\\eta^{-1}{\\cal O}_E$ is stalk ${\\cal O}_{E,y}$ , which is generally much bigger than the fiber $E_y$ . My questions are: Are there any topological conditions on $\\eta \\colon Y \\to Z$ that will make the claim from the book true, and how to see that? Is the claim true if $\\eta \\colon Y \\to Z$ is $G/P \\to G/Q$ , where $G$ is complex simply connected semisimple Lie group, the map is induced from inclusion of parabolic subgroups $P \\subset Q$ , and $E$ is homogeneous vector bundle? Any help of reference is appreciated. P.S.
