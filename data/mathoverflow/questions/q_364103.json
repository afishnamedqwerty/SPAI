  "body": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $I \\subseteq R$ be a nilpotent ideal. Let moreover $M$ be an $R$ -module, and let $IM$ be the submodule generated by the products $xm$ with $x \\in I$ and $m \\in M$ . It is quite easy to prove that, if $M/IM$ is finitely generated as an $R$ -module, then $M$ is finitely generated. Indeed, let $\\tilde{m}_1, \\ldots , \\tilde{m}_k$ be generators of $M/IM$ and lift them to elements $m_1, \\ldots, m_k$ in $M$ . Call $N$ the submodule generated by $m_1, \\ldots, m_k$ : then, we see that $$ M= N + IM. $$ Indeed, take $m \\in M$ . By definition of the $m_i$ , we have $r_1,\\ldots,r_k \\in R$ such that $m - \\sum_i r_im_i$ lies in $IM$ . Now, since $I$ is nilpotent, we conclude (a variant of Nakayama's lemma if you want) that $M=N$ , and we are done. What about finite presentation ? Namely: Let us assume that $I$ is nilpotent and also finitely presented as an $R$ -module. Can I conclude that if $M/IM$ is finitely presented as an $R$ -module, then the same is true for $M$ ? (if necessary, I can also assume that $R$ is a coherent ring ). ac.commutative-algebra ra.rings-and-algebras nonnoetherian Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 25, 2020 at 12:54 asked Jun 25, 2020 at 12:00 Francesco Genovese 2,109 12 12 silver badges 18 18 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ I'm not sure how you apply Nakayama in this case, even though I believe the conclusion is true, i.e. that $M$ is f.g. The way I see it is by multiplying the identity $M=N+IM$ by $I^j$ for $j=1,\\dots, k-1$ where $k$ is such that $I^k=0$, and then working backwards. $\\endgroup$ Chris –  Chris 2020-06-25 12:50:07 +00:00 Commented Jun 25, 2020 at 12:50 1 $\\begingroup$ It's a \"variant\" of Nakayama: more or less as you say, $M=N+IM$ is the same as $M/N= I(M/N)$, so if $I$ is nilpotent then $M/N=0$. This works for the finitely generated case. My question is about finite presentation , which I feel is quite more difficult... $\\endgroup$ Francesco Genovese –  Francesco Genovese 2020-06-25 12:53:57 +00:00 Commented Jun 25, 2020 at 12:53 $\\begingroup$ By the way: if $R$ is Noetherian, then finitely generated and finitely presented modules coincide, so the result is true. Hence, I believe that the assumption of $R$ being coherent is kind of necessary... I'll perhaps modify the original post. $\\endgroup$ Francesco Genovese –  Francesco Genovese 2020-07-11 18:06:17 +00:00 Commented Jul 11, 2020 at 18:06 1 $\\begingroup$ No. $R=k[X_n\\mid n\\in\\mathbb{N}]/(X_1^2)$ is coherent (if $k$ is a field), and the ideal $I$ $=$ $X_1R$ is nilpotent and f.p. If $J$ $=$ $\\Sigma\\,_{n>1}\\,X_1X_nR$, then $M=R/J$ is not f.p., yet $M/IM$ $=$ $R/(I+J)$ $=$ $R/I$ is. $\\endgroup$ Matthé van der Lee –  Matthé van der Lee 2020-07-21 18:01:43 +00:00 Commented Jul 21, 2020 at 18:01 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
