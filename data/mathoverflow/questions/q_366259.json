  "body": "Let $a^{ij}, b_{i}, c$ and $f>0$ are smooth function. Suppose $\\Lambda I\\geq (a^{ij})\\geq \\lambda I$ , where $I$ is identity matrix, $\\lambda, \\Lambda$ is positive constant. Is there solution of the following equation $$ \\sum_{i,j}^{n}a^{ij}u_{i}u_{j}+\\sum_{i}b_{i}u_{i}+cu=f$$ on a domain $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ or a closed $n-$ dimension manifold, where $u_{i}=\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_{i}}$ ? If not, are there known condidtions ensuring that this equation admits a soulution or locally solution? ap.analysis-of-pdes Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 24, 2020 at 6:08 asked Jul 22, 2020 at 5:20 liding 153 9 9 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 8 1 $\\begingroup$ Is $u_i$ the partial derivative with respect to $x_i$, or something else? $\\endgroup$ David Roberts –  David Roberts ♦ 2020-07-22 06:51:05 +00:00 Commented Jul 22, 2020 at 6:51 $\\begingroup$ Yes ,it is the partial derivative with respet to $x_{i}$. Thank you and D. Tampieri for pointing out it. $\\endgroup$ liding –  liding 2020-07-22 07:24:42 +00:00 Commented Jul 22, 2020 at 7:24 2 $\\begingroup$ There's not always a solution. Just look at $(u')^2 = -1$ when $n=1$. Are you asking for sufficient conditions that a solution exist? Would existence of local solutions suffice for what you want? Perhaps you can make your question more precise. $\\endgroup$ Robert Bryant –  Robert Bryant 2020-07-22 09:18:44 +00:00 Commented Jul 22, 2020 at 9:18 $\\begingroup$ I have a PDE similar with this problem on closed manifold. I just want to find a solution. Both the sufficient conditions and the local solution will help me. $\\endgroup$ liding –  liding 2020-07-22 14:43:05 +00:00 Commented Jul 22, 2020 at 14:43 3 $\\begingroup$ This isn't a general first order scalar PDE, but of a particular sort: If $M$ is a Riemannian manifold with metric $a$, $b$ is a vector field on $M$, and $c$ and $f$ are functions on $M$, the equation becomes $$|\\nabla u|_a^2 + 2b\\,\\cdot\\nabla u+c\\,u - f =0.$$ (In the flat case, the inequalities on $a$ ensure that the metric is complete.) Writing it as $$|\\nabla u+b|_a^2 + c\\,u - (f+|b|^2_a) = 0,$$ makes it clearer when solutions exist in a neighborhood of a point. For example $c(x)\\not=0$ or $f(x)+ |b(x)|^2_a>0$ would guarantee local solutions near $x$, by the method of characteristics. $\\endgroup$ Robert Bryant –  Robert Bryant 2020-07-24 10:18:15 +00:00 Commented Jul 24, 2020 at 10:18  |  Show 3 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
