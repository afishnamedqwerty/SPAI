  "title": "Analysis of coefficients for quickly vanishing analytic vector field",
  "body": "Let $u = (u_1, u_2, u_3): \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a divergence-free analytic vector field for $n =3$ or $n =4$ , i.e., $u_i : \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ are analytic functions locally given by $$u_i(x) = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}_0^n} c_j^{(i)} \\cdot \\prod_{k=1}^n x_k^{j_k}$$ for some real $c_j^{(i)}$ . Furthermore, we request $$|\\partial_x^{\\alpha} u(x)| \\leq C_{\\alpha K}(1+|x|)^{-K}$$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for any $\\alpha,K$ . My question is now, can we infer some requirements for the coefficients $c_j^{(i)}$ , such that the above conditions are equivalent to these requirements. fa.functional-analysis real-analysis ap.analysis-of-pdes ca.classical-analysis-and-odes differential-operators Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 13, 2020 at 7:08 asked Aug 12, 2020 at 17:39 tobias 759 3 3 silver badges 9 9 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ An obvious requirement is implied by Cauchy-Hadamard: $$ \\limsup_{j\\in\\Bbb N_0^n}\\sqrt[|j|]{|c_j^{(I)}|}=0.$$ Probably you can see how this restriction works jointly with the derivative growth estimate you’re interested to. $\\endgroup$ Daniele Tampieri –  Daniele Tampieri 2020-08-12 19:24:24 +00:00 Commented Aug 12, 2020 at 19:24 $\\begingroup$ A few clarifications requested: (a) when you say $u_i$ is analytic, are you assuming necessarily that it has infinite radius of convergence? (Technically $1/(1+x^2)$ is a real analytic function too.) (b) What are the \"conditions\" in your question? Are you assuming divergence free throughout, or are you looking for a requirement that is equal to \"divergence free + rapid decay\"? $\\endgroup$ Willie Wong –  Willie Wong 2020-08-12 20:10:09 +00:00 Commented Aug 12, 2020 at 20:10 $\\begingroup$ I am doubtful you can see decay rates at infinity just from some size estimates on the coefficients. $\\cos(x^2)$ and $e^{-x^2}$ have very similar Taylor series. $\\endgroup$ Willie Wong –  Willie Wong 2020-08-12 20:15:42 +00:00 Commented Aug 12, 2020 at 20:15 $\\begingroup$ @WillieWong a) You are right, I consider all (!) analytic functions that meet the conditions from above. b) The conditions are, analytic, divergence-free everywhere, and the inequalities. $\\endgroup$ tobias –  tobias 2020-08-12 20:21:41 +00:00 Commented Aug 12, 2020 at 20:21 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
