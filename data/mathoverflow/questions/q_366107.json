  "body": "I have a question about fixed points which are almost stable. I have an increasing transition function $f:[0,1]\\rightarrow[0,1]$ where $f(0)>0$ and $f(1)<1$ but I don't necessarily have continuity. I call any $x$ that satisfies $f(x)=x$ as a steady state. Part 1) I can show that there exists a steady state $x$ with the property that $\\forall \\epsilon > 0$ , $\\exists \\delta$ such that If $y \\in [x,x+\\delta]$ , then $\\underset{n \\rightarrow \\infty}{\\lim} \\overbrace{f\\circ \\ldots \\circ f}^{n\\text{ times}} (x) \\in [x,x+\\epsilon]$ This steady state is \"almost\" right absorbing because for sufficiently small right deviations, you will not necessarily end up at the steady state, but you cannot end up too far from it. However, I do not know if there is a more precise term for such a steady state. Part 2) I know that there is an $x$ which satisfies the following properties: $\\exists \\epsilon>0$ such that $\\forall y \\in (x,x+\\epsilon)$ it is the case that $f(y)<y$ . (This is an absorbing state) or $\\forall \\epsilon >0$ $\\exists y \\in (x,x+\\epsilon)$ such that $f(y)=y$ or (This means that x is the limit of steady states from the right) I've gone over many phrases for which to call such a steady state (right contained, right non-repelling), but I am not sure if there is some standard terminology for this kind of steady state. Notice that it is also equivalent to the condition that $\\forall \\epsilon>0$ $\\exists y \\in (x,x+\\epsilon)$ such that $f(y)\\leq y$ . terminology notation fixed-point-theorems stability Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 20, 2020 at 15:01 MDR 348 1 1 silver badge 6 6 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 6 $\\begingroup$ Perhaps the first one is referred to as Lyapunov stability? $\\endgroup$ MDR –  MDR 2020-07-20 15:32:35 +00:00 Commented Jul 20, 2020 at 15:32 $\\begingroup$ Equicontinuity? $\\endgroup$ Ville Salo –  Ville Salo 2020-07-20 16:55:07 +00:00 Commented Jul 20, 2020 at 16:55 $\\begingroup$ Hi Ville, thanks. I think that you mean uniform continuity and it's a nice idea, but not quite enough. I venture that you were going to suggest that with uniform continuity, y is close to f(y) and f(y) is close to f(f(y)), which is close to f(f(f(y))) and so on. But, unfortunately, even if it's true, the whole system may eventually drift very far from y. Also, I don't even have that f is continuous. $\\endgroup$ MDR –  MDR 2020-07-20 17:17:14 +00:00 Commented Jul 20, 2020 at 17:17 $\\begingroup$ No I mean equicontinuity of $(f_n)_n$ $\\endgroup$ Ville Salo –  Ville Salo 2020-07-20 17:18:54 +00:00 Commented Jul 20, 2020 at 17:18 $\\begingroup$ $(f^n)_n$ I mean $\\endgroup$ Ville Salo –  Ville Salo 2020-07-20 18:00:44 +00:00 Commented Jul 20, 2020 at 18:00  |  Show 1 more comment 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
