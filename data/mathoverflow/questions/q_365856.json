  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - Whether a particular fiber product of varieties is integral",
  "body": "Let $X,Y,Z$ be irreducible projective varieties over $\\mathbb{C}$ (you can assume all of them are normal), and let $f:X\\rightarrow Z, g: Y\\rightarrow Z$ be two birational projective morphisms, such that there is a common open set $U\\subset Z$ with $f_U:f^{-1}(U)\\simeq U$ and $g_U:g^{-1}(U)\\simeq U$ , If $W:= Z-U$ , then $f_W: f^{-1}(W)\\rightarrow W$ and $g_W: g^{-1}(W)\\rightarrow W$ are projective bundles of ranks $m,n$ respectively, and codim $(W)=1+m+n$ . Is it true that $X\\times_{Z}Y$ is integral? I have seen a statement along this line, but can't prove it. Any help would be really appreciated. Edit : Thanks to R. van Dobben de Bruyn's comment, the answer to the question as I stated earlier was false. I had skipped the codimension condition. ag.algebraic-geometry birational-geometry Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 17, 2020 at 16:59 asked Jul 17, 2020 at 13:07 Hajime_Saito 777 3 3 silver badges 7 7 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 4 $\\begingroup$ This is false. For example, let $f$ and $g$ both be the blowup $\\tilde X \\to X$ at a point $p$ in a smooth variety $X$ of dimension $d \\geq 3$. Then the exceptional divisor is $\\mathbf P^{d-1}$, so the fibre product has a subvariety isomorphic to $\\mathbf P^{d-1} \\times \\mathbf P^{d-1}$ lying over $p$. But $2d-2 > d$, so $\\tilde X \\times_X \\tilde X$ has components of different dimensions! $\\endgroup$ R. van Dobben de Bruyn –  R. van Dobben de Bruyn 2020-07-17 14:24:57 +00:00 Commented Jul 17, 2020 at 14:24 $\\begingroup$ @R.vanDobbendeBruyn : Thanks for the answer! Actually, there were more conditions on the codimension of $W$, but I thought that it was not required. I have edited my question. $\\endgroup$ Hajime_Saito –  Hajime_Saito 2020-07-17 16:54:45 +00:00 Commented Jul 17, 2020 at 16:54 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
