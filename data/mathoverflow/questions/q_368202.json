  "title": "gr.group theory - RSA as a hidden subgroup problem",
  "body": "The Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) covers several known problems (e.g. Integer Factorization Problem, Discrete Logarithm Problem) as a special case: Definition [Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP)] Let $\\mathbb{G}$ be a group and $\\mathbb{H}$ an unknown subgroup of $\\mathbb{G}$ , i.e., $\\mathbb{H} \\leq \\mathbb{G}$ . Let $S$ be any set and $f$ be a function that maps the group elements of $\\mathbb{G}$ to $S$ , i.e., $f: \\mathbb{G} \\rightarrow S$ . The function $S$ has the special property that it can distinguish cosets of $\\mathbb{H}$ : $$ f(e_1) = f(e_2) \\Leftrightarrow e_1\\mathbb{H} = e_2\\mathbb{H} $$ The Hidden Subgroup Problem is, given $\\mathbb{G}$ and (oracle-)access to the function $f$ , to determine a generating set for the subgroup $\\mathbb{H}$ . I found several papers which show how to instantiate the involved groups and functions, for example in case of the Integer Factorization Problem: $$\\mathbb{G} = \\mathbb{Z}^+_{\\varphi(N)}; \\mathbb{H} = \\langle r\\rangle^+; S = \\mathbb{Z}^*_N, f(x)=g^x\\pmod{N}$$ whereof the integer $r$ is the order of the multiplicative group generated by $g$ . I am trying to find a direct HSP approach to the RSA problem, without to find the order of a subgroup or to factorize the modulus by any other methods. RSA Problem: Given an RSA modulus $N$ and a public exponent $e$ and an integer $C$ , find $m$ such that $m^e \\equiv C \\pmod{N}$ I came up with the following solution, but i am not sure if it is valid according to the definition of the HSP, since it contains $m$ , the target integer, in the description of the group operation. Let $\\mathbb{G} = (\\mathbb{Z},\\circ_m)$ and $\\mathbb{H} = \\{0, m, m+N, m+2N, m+3N,\\ldots\\}$ , $S = \\mathbb{Z}^*_N$ as well as $f(x) = x^e\\pmod{N}$ . The group operation that is defined on $\\mathbb{G}$ is $\\circ_m(a,b) := a+b-m$ . So $\\circ$ makes $\\mathbb{H}$ a subgroup of $\\mathbb{G}$ (neutral element is $m$ and inverse is $a^{-1} = 2m-a$ ). And $f$ can distinguish $N$ cosets of $\\mathbb{H}$ : $$c\\mathbb{H} = \\{m+c, m+c+N, m+c+2N,\\ldots\\}$$ . Does the term \"given a group $\\mathbb{G}$ \" forbid the definition of a valid but non accessible group operation? Is it enough that someone could, even not knowing $m$ , compute $\\circ_m(a,b)-\\circ_m(u,v) = a+b-u-v$ ? -- (i asked this question also on cstheory.stackexchange ( here ) but did not get an answer) gr.group-theory cryptography Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 3, 2020 at 11:13 asked Aug 3, 2020 at 10:50 Etsch 131 2 2 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 $\\begingroup$ Link to the question on cstheory? $\\endgroup$ Gerry Myerson –  Gerry Myerson 2020-08-03 10:55:56 +00:00 Commented Aug 3, 2020 at 10:55 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
