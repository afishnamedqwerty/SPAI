  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - An explicit description of $A_X$",
  "body": "Let $X$ be a smooth complex projective curve of genus at least $2$ and $p\\in X$ . Define $$A_X=H^0(X-p,\\mathcal O_X).$$ By choosing a local parameter $z$ near $p$ we can see $A_X\\subset Frac(\\hat{O}_{X,p})=K\\cong \\mathbb C((z))$ . Is there any explicit description of $A_X$ inside $K$ ? I mean given $f\\in K$ , what conditions are required on $f$ so that it is in $A_X$ ? Are the only units of this ring are the non vanishing constants? ag.algebraic-geometry algebraic-curves Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Apr 8, 2017 at 14:33 7100note4 51 3 3 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ It's unclear to me what you mean. Is $\\mathcal{O}_X$ the sheaf of regular or holomorphic functions? If it's the first, then do you want $\\hat O_{X,p}$ above or....? If its the second, then you can have essential singularities... $\\endgroup$ Donu Arapura –  Donu Arapura 2017-04-08 15:30:52 +00:00 Commented Apr 8, 2017 at 15:30 $\\begingroup$ I mean the first and that's just an errata! $\\endgroup$ 7100note4 –  7100note4 2017-04-08 15:51:36 +00:00 Commented Apr 8, 2017 at 15:51 $\\begingroup$ Are the only units of this ring are the non vanishing constants? $\\endgroup$ 7100note4 –  7100note4 2017-04-12 09:48:38 +00:00 Commented Apr 12, 2017 at 9:48 1 $\\begingroup$ Yes. The divisor of a meromorphic function has degree zero. If $f\\in A_X$ is a unit, it has no zero in $X-p$, hence its divisor is $0$ and $f$ is constant. $\\endgroup$ abx –  abx 2017-04-12 09:56:40 +00:00 Commented Apr 12, 2017 at 9:56 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
