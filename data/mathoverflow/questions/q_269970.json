  "body": "Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, $p\\in X$ and $U_p$ a neighborhood of $p$ such that there exists a bi-Lipschitz map $F:U_p\\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ (we regard $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the usual Euclidean metric). Let us also assume that the Lipschitz constant of $F$ is almost $1$ , i.e., $ (1+\\varepsilon)^{-1}d(x,y) \\leq \\| F(x)-F(y)\\| \\leq (1+\\varepsilon)d(x,y)$ , where $\\varepsilon>0$ is very small (but fixed). Now, let us denote $\\overline{B_r(p)} = \\{ x\\in X \\mid d(x,p)\\leq r \\}$ $S_r(p)=\\{x\\in X \\mid d(x,p)=r\\}$ Then for a small enough $r$ , so that $\\overline{B_r(p)}\\subseteq U_p$ , the bi-Lipschitz condition implies that $B_{(1+\\varepsilon)^{-1}r}(F(p))\\subset F(B_r(p))\\subset B_{(1+\\varepsilon)r}(F(p))$ . Question Is it true that the set $F(S_r(p))$ is homotopy equivalent to $S_{(1+\\varepsilon)r}(F(p))$ (or $S_{(1+\\varepsilon)^{-1}r}(F(p))$ ) for sufficiently small $r$ ? If this is the case, is it possible to make the homotopy proper? If this is too much to ask, is it true if one assumes that $X$ is an Alexandrov space with CBB and $p$ is a regular point? mg.metric-geometry alexandrov-geometry Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked May 16, 2017 at 21:18 Zimbrón 85 6 6 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
