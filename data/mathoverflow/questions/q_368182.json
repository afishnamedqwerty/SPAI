  "title": "gr.group theory - Question about generalizing Cauchy identity",
  "body": "One of the Cauchy identities says that $$\\prod_{i,j}(1+x_iy_j) = \\sum_\\lambda s_\\lambda (x_1, \\cdots,x_m) s_{\\lambda'} (y_1, \\cdots,y_n) $$ Where $\\lambda$ is a Young diagram, $\\lambda'$ is the transpose diagram, and $s$ is the Schur polynomial. I would like to elevate $x_i$ and $y_j$ to $d$ dimensional vectors $\\vec x_i$ and $\\vec y_j$ . Is there any generalized Cauchy identity, or any other nice closed form, for $$\\prod_{i,j}(1+\\vec x_i\\cdot \\vec y_j),$$ with $d>1$ ? gr.group-theory rt.representation-theory symmetric-groups linear-groups Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Aug 3, 2020 at 2:10 Sepehrius 121 2 2 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
