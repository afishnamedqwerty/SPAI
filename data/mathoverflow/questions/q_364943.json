  "body": "Let $y\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$ , $\\tau\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ , with $\\tau>0$ I would like to efficiently solve the following problem: Problem 1 Choose $\\alpha,z\\in\\mathbb{R}^m,\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ to minimize: $$(y-\\alpha)^\\top (y-\\alpha) + \\tau \\beta^\\top \\beta$$ subject to the constraints that: $$z=X\\beta$$ $$\\beta^\\top 1_n = 1$$ $$\\beta\\ge 0$$ $$\\forall i,j\\in\\{1,\\dots,m\\}, z_i\\le z_j \\rightarrow \\alpha_i \\le \\alpha_j$$ (Here $1_n\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector of ones.) The final constraint is equivalent to: $$\\forall i,j\\in\\{1,\\dots,m\\}, (z_j-z_i,\\alpha_j-\\alpha_i)\\in\\left\\{(c,d)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\middle|c\\le 0 \\vee d\\ge 0\\right\\},$$ which is clearly non-convex. While the problem can be given a mixed integer quadratic programming formulation, this is unlikely to be computationally feasible. However, if we knew $z=\\hat z$ , Problem 1 reduces to: Problem 2 Choose $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$ to minimize: $$(y-\\alpha)^\\top (y-\\alpha)$$ subject to the constraints that: $$\\forall i,j\\in\\{1,\\dots,m\\}, \\hat z_i\\le \\hat z_j \\rightarrow \\alpha_i \\le \\alpha_j$$ This is the isotonic regression problem, and may be solved very efficiently by the pooled adjacent violators algorithm. Likewise, if we knew $\\alpha=\\hat\\alpha$ , then Problem 1 reduces to: Problem 3 Choose $z\\in\\mathbb{R}^m,\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ to minimize: $$\\beta^\\top \\beta$$ subject to the constraints that: $$z=X\\beta$$ $$\\beta^\\top 1_n = 1$$ $$\\beta\\ge 0$$ $$\\forall i,j\\in\\{1,\\dots,m\\}, \\hat\\alpha_i > \\hat\\alpha_j \\rightarrow z_i > z_j$$ This is a simple quadratic programming problem (at least once the strict inequality on $z$ is replaced by a weak one with a small margin). Question My question is whether Problem 2 or Problem 3 can be exploited to give a computationally feasible (iterative?) algorithm for Problem 1. I would of course also be interested in any other approach to efficiently solving Problem 1. Note that the naïve algorithm of alternating between solving Problem 2 and solving Problem 3 cannot possibly converge to a solution of Problem 1, as neither Problem 2 nor 3 depend on $\\tau$ . oc.optimization-and-control quadratic-programming non-convex-optimization Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 6, 2020 at 16:21 asked Jul 6, 2020 at 10:47 cfp 183 1 1 silver badge 8 8 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 1 $\\begingroup$ or.stackexchange.com $\\endgroup$ Rodrigo de Azevedo –  Rodrigo de Azevedo 2020-07-08 09:42:30 +00:00 Commented Jul 8, 2020 at 9:42 1 $\\begingroup$ Good suggestion!
