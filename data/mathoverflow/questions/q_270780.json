  "body": "Let $G$ be a finite (not necessarily abelian) group and let $\\mathcal{X}\\to D^*$ be a $G$-gerbe over the punctured disk $D^*$. Is there a finite etale cover $D^*\\to \\mathcal{X}$? I think of $G$-gerbes as higher analogues of $G$-torsors. If $X\\to D^*$ is a $G$-torsor, then $X$ is in fact isomorphic to $D^*$ and the morphism $X\\to D^*$ is given by $z\\mapsto z^e$ for some $e\\geq 1$. Is there a similar picture for $G$-gerbes? (I should stress that I assume $\\mathcal X$ and $X$ to be connected.) ag.algebraic-geometry complex-geometry stacks complex-manifolds gerbes Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jan 10, 2019 at 16:47 Praphulla Koushik 6,223 3 3 gold badges 29 29 silver badges 74 74 bronze badges asked May 26, 2017 at 18:47 Porto Vino 11 1 1 bronze badge $\\endgroup$ 5 $\\begingroup$ Are there any nontrivial gerbes over $D^*$ at all?

Maybe my expectation was too naive? $\\endgroup$ Porto Vino –  Porto Vino 2017-05-26 19:04:05 +00:00 Commented May 26, 2017 at 19:04 6 $\\begingroup$ Torsors under $G$ correspond to $H^1(D^*, G) = {\\rm Hom}(\\pi_1(D^*), G) = G$, while gerbes correspond to $H^2(D^*, G)$, which is zero (at least for abelian groups). $\\endgroup$ Piotr Achinger –  Piotr Achinger 2017-05-26 19:33:05 +00:00 Commented May 26, 2017 at 19:33 $\\begingroup$ @PiotrAchinger Let $L$ be a band. (These are classified by $H^1(D^*,Out(G))$, so this set can be non-trivial. Take for example a group $G$ with $Out(G) = \\mu_n$.) The set of $G$-gerbes with band $L$ is (when non-empty) a torsor under the trivial group $H^2(D^*,Z(G))$. The latter is trivial by your remark. So, up to the choice of a (possibly non-trivial?) band, all $G$-gerbes are trivial. Does that sound right? $\\endgroup$ Porto Vino –  Porto Vino 2017-05-27 09:22:36 +00:00 Commented May 27, 2017 at 9:22 $\\begingroup$ @PortoVino topologically, at least, such gerbes on the punctured disk should correspond to $pi_1$ of a certain classifying space, namely the classifying space of the crossed module $\\mathop{Ad}\\colon G\\to \\mathop{Aut}(G)$. I think in this case ($G$ discrete) that $pi_1 = \\mathop{Out}(G)$ $\\endgroup$ David Roberts –  David Roberts ♦ 2019-01-11 02:35:47 +00:00 Commented Jan 11, 2019 at 2:35 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
