  "body": "This question is related to (but different from) that of Darsh Ranjan. Is there a characterization of the functions $f:\\mathbb R^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb R_{\\ge0}$ whose Radon transform $\\hat f(\\omega,t)$ is log-concave in $t$ for every $\\omega\\in S^{n-1}$ ? Recall that $$\\hat f(\\omega,t)=\\int_{\\omega\\cdot x=t}f(x)d\\mathcal L_{n-1}(x),$$ with $\\mathcal L_{n-1}$ the $(n-1)$-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Recall also that $g\\ge0$ is log-concave if $\\log g$ is concave. It is OK for me if one assumes that $f$ is integrable with compact support. The motivation comes from a paper in collaboration with Th. Gallay, to appear in CPAM. With each $N\\times N$ complex matrix $A$, we associate a numerical measure , which is a probability supported by the numerical range $W(A)\\subset\\mathbb C$. It is absolutey continuous with piecewise smooth density $f_A$. This density has the Radon-log-concavity property mentioned above. When $A$ is normal, $f_A$ is itself log-concave, thanks to the Prékopa-Leindler theorem. But this is no longer true for a non-normal matrix. If $N=2$, this fails already. ca.classical-analysis-and-odes convexity pr.probability matrices Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Apr 13, 2017 at 12:58 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Jan 31, 2011 at 14:37 Denis Serre 53.1k 10 10 gold badges 153 153 silver badges 316 316 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ What's the connection between $N$ in the second paragraph and $n$ in the first? $\\endgroup$ John Bentin –  John Bentin 2011-01-31 16:37:18 +00:00 Commented Jan 31, 2011 at 16:37 $\\begingroup$ @John.
