  "body": "Let $Y$ be an affine, integral, Gorenstein surface. Let $y \\in Y$ be a closed point such that there exists a finite, etale morphism $f: X \\to Y\\backslash \\{y\\}$ from an integral variety $X$ to the open subvariety $Y \\backslash y$ . Does there exist an integeral variety $\\overline{X}$ containing $X$ as an open dense subscheme and a finite morphism $\\overline{f}: \\overline{X} \\to Y$ restricting to $f$ over $X$ such that the fiber over $y$ consists of exactly one closed point (not necessarily reduced)? ag.algebraic-geometry etale-covers Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 11, 2020 at 21:22 user45397 2,629 15 15 silver badges 25 25 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 2 $\\begingroup$ Yes: first choose any finite morphism $g:Z \\to Y$ extending $f$ with $Z$ integral (e.g., by normalizing $Y$ in $X$), and then construct $\\overline{X}$ by crushing the finite closed subscheme $g^{-1}(y) \\subset Z$ to a single point (so take a suitable fibre product at the level of rings). $\\endgroup$ Anonymous –  Anonymous 2020-07-12 03:13:31 +00:00 Commented Jul 12, 2020 at 3:13 $\\begingroup$ @Anonymous Thank you. Could you put this in the answer. Especially, could you elaborate a little (or give reference) for what you mean by \"crushing\". Is it something like blowing down? If so, why does a \"crushing\" always exist? I think the answer lies in what you say \"suitable fibre product at the level of rings\", but this statement is not clear to me. $\\endgroup$ user45397 –  user45397 2020-07-12 05:55:19 +00:00 Commented Jul 12, 2020 at 5:55 1 $\\begingroup$ For the existence of the crushing (also called \"pinching\", or Ferrand pushout) see this paper , or this section of the Stacks Project. $\\endgroup$ Laurent Moret-Bailly –  Laurent Moret-Bailly 2020-07-12 07:19:12 +00:00 Commented Jul 12, 2020 at 7:19 1 $\\begingroup$ In this case the construction is very simple: take $g$ as in Anonymous's comment. Then $\\ol{X}=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathscr{A}))$ where $\\mathscr{A}\\subset g_*\\mathscr{O}_Z$ is the subalgebra of sections whose restriction on $g^{-1}(y)$ is constant (i.e. comes from $\\kappa(y)$). $\\endgroup$ Laurent Moret-Bailly –  Laurent Moret-Bailly 2020-07-12 07:29:14 +00:00 Commented Jul 12, 2020 at 7:29 $\\begingroup$ @LaurentMoret-Bailly and Anonymous; Thank you for the answer $\\endgroup$ user45397 –  user45397 2020-07-12 10:32:39 +00:00 Commented Jul 12, 2020 at 10:32 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
