  "body": "Consider $u = u(\\phi,\\psi)$ where $\\phi = \\phi(x)$ and $\\psi =\\psi(x)$ are both analytic function. The following equation $$\\partial_x u - u\\partial_x (\\phi-\\psi)=0$$ has a trivial solution $u(\\phi,\\psi) = c\\,e^{\\phi-\\psi}$ , where $c$ is a constant. Note that $u(\\phi,\\psi) = c\\,e^{\\phi-\\psi}$ solves the above equation for whatever function of $x$ $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ is. This equation doesn't seems to be an ordinary differential equation because none function of $x$ whas found. Is it a functional differential equation? I'm wondering to solve the following equation $$\\partial_x v - v\\partial_x(\\phi+\\psi) = e^{\\phi-\\psi} - e^{-\\phi+\\psi}$$ where the aim is to find $v = v(\\phi,\\psi)$ . How do I call (or classify) differential equations where the aim is to find a function that depends of another function like those shown above? PS: Such equations appears in the context of algebraic description of Backlund Transformation via gauge transformation. fa.functional-analysis differential-equations functional-equations Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 25, 2020 at 22:17 Jogean Carvalho 1 $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ If I understand correctly you want a solution $y(x)$ of the ODE $$y'(x)-y(x)\\big(\\phi'(x)-\\psi'(x)\\big)= e^{\\phi(x)-\\psi(x)}-e^{-\\phi(x)+\\psi(x)},$$ AND you want this solution to be of the form $y(x):=v(\\phi(x),\\psi(x))$ for some $2$-variable function $v(t,s)$. Is this the problem? $\\endgroup$ Pietro Majer –  Pietro Majer 2020-07-25 22:29:14 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 22:29 $\\begingroup$ If so, it seems the factorization is quite a disjoint problem from the linear ODE. The latter can be easily integrated and has a general solution of some form $y(x)=Y(x,\\phi(x),\\psi(x),C)$. So I'd say all you need is to write $x$ in terms of the given functins $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ as $$x=w(\\phi(x),\\psi(x)),$$ for some $2$-variable function $w$, and then define $$v(t,s):= Y(w(t,s),t,s,C)$$ so that $v(\\phi(x), \\psi(x))=y(x)$ $\\endgroup$ Pietro Majer –  Pietro Majer 2020-07-25 22:51:24 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 22:51 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
