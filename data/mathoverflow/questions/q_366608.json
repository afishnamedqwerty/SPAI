  "body": "Lagrange's theorem states for all $n\\in\\mathbb N,\\exists a',b',c',d'\\in\\mathbb N:a'^2+b'^2+c'^2+d'^2=n$ . Suppose we are given an $n$ and $a,b,c,d,e\\in\\mathbb N:a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+e^2=n$ is there a way to find $a',b',c',d'\\in\\mathbb N:a'^2+b'^2+c'^2+d'^2=n$ in terms of $a,b,c,d,e$ ? The point of the problem is to seek if there are extra structures to identifying sum of smaller number of squares from larger number. nt.number-theory algebraic-number-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 26, 2020 at 19:04 asked Jul 26, 2020 at 11:24 VS. 1,846 1 1 gold badge 12 12 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 6 2 $\\begingroup$ “Closed-form solution” is too vague. But if it implies that $a',b',c',d'$ is computable in polynomial time from $a,b,c,d,e$, this would in fact imply that you can find an expression of any given $n$ as four squares in deterministic polynomial time, whereas only randomized polynomial-time algorithms are currently known. $\\endgroup$ Emil Jeřábek –  Emil Jeřábek 2020-07-26 11:54:51 +00:00 Commented Jul 26, 2020 at 11:54 $\\begingroup$ $a'=f(a,b,c,d,e)$ where $f()$ is an arithmetic circuit. Probably weaker than what you are getting at. $\\endgroup$ VS. –  VS. 2020-07-26 11:56:36 +00:00 Commented Jul 26, 2020 at 11:56 $\\begingroup$ You can evaluate an arithmetic circuit in polynomial time. (You can evaluate it modulo $n$ to avoid large intermediate results.) Hence what I wrote applies. $\\endgroup$ Emil Jeřábek –  Emil Jeřábek 2020-07-26 12:30:48 +00:00 Commented Jul 26, 2020 at 12:30 2 $\\begingroup$ Why not just compute four squares from $n$? $\\endgroup$ Max Alekseyev –  Max Alekseyev 2020-07-26 14:14:51 +00:00 Commented Jul 26, 2020 at 14:14 $\\begingroup$ Yeah that defeats the point of the problem to ask if there are extra structures. $\\endgroup$ VS. –  VS. 2020-07-26 19:03:16 +00:00 Commented Jul 26, 2020 at 19:03  |  Show 1 more comment 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
