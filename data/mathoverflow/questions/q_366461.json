  "body": "Context. Studing a problem in machine-learning, I'm led to consider the following problem in RMT... Definition. Given positive integers $m$ and $n$ and positive real numbers $c_1$ and $c_2$ , let's say an $m$ -by- $n$ real matrix $X$ is $(c_1,c_2)$ -incrompressible if every submatrix of $Z$ with $k \\ge c_1 m$ rows and $n$ columns satisfies $c_2\\mathbb B^k \\subseteq Z\\mathbb B^n$ , where $c_2\\mathbb B^k$ is the ball of radius $c_2$ in $\\mathbb R^k$ and $Z\\mathbb B^n := \\{Zv \\mid v \\in \\mathbb B^n\\}$ . Question. Is the definition somehow linked to the classical \"restricted isometry property\" ? An answer to this the above question would allow me to directly tap into the vast RMT literature, for the purposes of attacking my subsequent questions (see below). Special case when $c_1=1$ . In the particular case where $c_1=1$ , we note that $X$ is $(1,c_2)$ -incompressible iff its smallest singular value is $c_2$ or greater. Now, fix $\\delta \\in (0, 1)$ once and for all. Question. Do there exist universal constants $c_1 > 0$ and $c_2 > 0$ (depending only on $\\delta$ ) such that the following phenomenon holds ? The phenomenon. Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers with $m \\le \\delta n$ and $n$ large, and let $k \\ge c_1 m$ . Let $X$ an $m$ -by- $n$ random real matrix with iid $N(0,1)$ entries. Question. With high probability, $X$ is $(c_1,c_2)$ -incompressible! Also, how large can this probability be as a function of $n$ and $\\delta$ ? pr.probability convex-geometry random-matrices geometric-probability Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 24, 2020 at 19:43 asked Jul 24, 2020 at 15:00 dohmatob 7,053 1 1 gold badge 20 20 silver badges 87 87 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ Is there no relation between $m$ and $n$ except that they are both large? If $n < k$, it's impossible to have $c_2 {\\mathbb B}^k \\subseteq Z \\mathbb B^n$. $\\endgroup$ Robert Israel –  Robert Israel 2020-07-24 15:53:42 +00:00 Commented Jul 24, 2020 at 15:53 $\\begingroup$ Indeed. Fixed. You may assume $m \\le \\delta n$ with $\\delta \\in (0, 1)$. Thus in the question, the universal constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ only depend on $\\delta$. $\\endgroup$ dohmatob –  dohmatob 2020-07-24 16:03:45 +00:00 Commented Jul 24, 2020 at 16:03 $\\begingroup$ I mean, if we're talking probabilistically, there is a nonzero probability of arbitrarily big balls being in the range. Maybe it's unlikely, but asymptotically you could fit some truly ginormous balls in there. $\\endgroup$ Rivers McForge –  Rivers McForge 2020-07-25 01:42:47 +00:00 Commented Jul 25, 2020 at 1:42 $\\begingroup$ Could you make this claim more formal ? $\\endgroup$ dohmatob –  dohmatob 2020-08-06 10:10:44 +00:00 Commented Aug 6, 2020 at 10:10 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
