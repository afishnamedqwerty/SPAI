Is it true that $u\\leq a$ in $\\Omega \\setminus B$ where $s\\in (0,1)$ and $\\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain. ap.analysis-of-pdes Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jun 27, 2020 at 13:26 Spal 299 2 2 silver badges 7 7 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
