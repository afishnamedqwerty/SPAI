Could you tell me please, how to prove the following statement (if it is true)? $$ \\lim_\\limits{M \\to \\infty} \\|T_A - T_b \\| = 0, $$ here operator norm defined as $\\|A\\| = \\sup_\\limits{\\| x \\| = 1}\\| Ax \\|$ , $x \\in \\ell^2$ . $T_A$ and $T_B$ are operators defined as $$ T_A = \\exp\\{\\alpha B\\}, $$ $$ T_B = \\left(E - \\frac{\\alpha}{M}B \\right)^{-(M - p)}, $$ here $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ , $M \\in \\mathbb{N}$ , $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ , and $B$ is the following linear operator $$ B = \\sum_{k} |k\\rangle \\langle k+1|. $$ fa.functional-analysis operator-theory hilbert-spaces limits-and-convergence Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jun 23, 2020 at 20:00 MightyPower 335 1 1 silver badge 10 10 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 $\\begingroup$ Is $E$ the identity operator? $\\endgroup$ Nate Eldredge –  Nate Eldredge 2020-06-23 20:10:35 +00:00 Commented Jun 23, 2020 at 20:10 $\\begingroup$ @Nate Eldredge, Yes E - identity operator. $\\endgroup$ MightyPower –  MightyPower 2020-06-23 20:27:59 +00:00 Commented Jun 23, 2020 at 20:27 $\\begingroup$ @Nate Eldredge, Why?
