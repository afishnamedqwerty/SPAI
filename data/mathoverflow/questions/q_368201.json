  "body": "Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space without isolated points and of diameter $1$ . Let $Y=\\{y_m\\}_{m=1}^{\\infty}$ be a dense subset of $X$ . Define $g_0\\equiv 1$ , and for $m>0$ let $g_m=d(\\cdot,y_1)\\dotsm d(\\cdot,y_m)$ . I wonder if $\\{g_0,g_1,\\dotsc\\}$ separates points of $X$ in the following strong sense: If $x_1,\\dotsc,x_n\\in X$ , $a_1,\\dotsc,a_n\\in\\mathbb{R}$ are such that $a_1g_m(x_1)+\\dotsb+a_ng_m(x_n)=0$ , for every $m=0,1,\\dotsc$ , then $a_1=\\dotsb=a_n=0$ . Some partial progress: Let's show that WLOG $x_1,\\dotsc,x_n\\not\\in Y$ . Assume that $x_1,\\dotsc,x_k\\in \\{y_1,\\dotsc,y_l\\}$ and $x_{k+1},\\dotsc,x_n\\not\\in Y$ . Then $g_l(x_1)=\\dotsb=g_l(x_k)=0$ , and $g_l(x_{k+1})=\\dotsb=g_l(x_n)\\ne 0$ . Take $Z=\\{z_m=y_{m+l}\\}_{m=1}^{\\infty}$ , which is still dense in $X$ , and let $h_m=d(\\cdot,z_1)\\dotsm d(\\cdot,z_m)$ , $h_0\\equiv 1$ . Then $g_{m+l}=g_l h_m$ , for every $m$ . For every $m$ we have \\begin{gather*} 0=a_1g_{m+l}(x_1)+\\dotsb+a_ng_{m+l}(x_n)=a_1g_l(x_1)h_m(x_1)+\\dotsb+a_ng_l(x_n)h_m(x_n) \\\\ =a_{k+1}g_l(x_{k+1})h_m(x_{k+1})+\\dotsb+a_ng_l(x_n)h_m(x_n), \\end{gather*} and since we \"can\" prove the statement with $x_{k+1},\\dotsc,x_n\\not\\in Z$ , it follows that $a_{k+1}g_l(x_{k+1})=\\dotsb=a_ng_l(x_n)=0$ , from where $a_{k+1}=\\dotsb=a_n=0$ . Now assume that $x_k$ is $y_m$ with the biggest $m$ . Then $0=a_1g_{m-1}(x_1)+\\dotsb+a_ng_{m-1}(x_n)=a_kg_{m-1}(x_k)$ , from where $a_k=0$ , and so on. Let us prove the statement for $n=2,3$ . Let $x$ , $y$ , $z$ be distinct. First, assume that $ag_m(x)=cg_m(z)$ , for every $m=0,1,\\dotsc$ . Since $Y$ is dense, there is $m$ such that $d(x,y_{m+1})<d(z,y_{m+1})$ . But then either $a=0=c$ , or $ag_m(x)=cg_m(z)$ and $ag_{m+1}(x)=cg_{m+1}(z)$ are incompatible. Now assume that $ag_m(x)+cg_m(z)=bg_m(y)$ , where $a,b,c>0$ . Again, using density, there is $m$ such that $d(y,y_{m+1})<d(x,y_{m+1})$ and $d(y,y_{m+1})<d(z,y_{m+1})$ , which leads to $ag_{m+1}(x)+cg_{m+1}(z)>bg_{m+1}(y)$ . Similar arguments work if we assume that all of $a_k$ but one are of the same sign. But even if two are positive and two are negative I am at a loss. linear-algebra gn.general-topology mg.metric-geometry Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 5, 2020 at 4:22 LSpice 14k 4 4 gold badges 48 48 silver badges 76 76 bronze badges asked Aug 3, 2020 at 10:36 erz 5,693 1 1 gold badge 20 20 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 7 $\\begingroup$ So the $n=3$ case says: If $$a PX + b PY + c PZ = a PX\\, QX + b PY\\, QY + c PZ\\, QZ = a PX\\, QX\\, RX + b PY\\, QY\\, RY + c PZ\\, QZ\\, RZ = \\cdots =0$$ where the dots continue $P,Q,R$ through a dense subset, then $a=b=c=0$.
