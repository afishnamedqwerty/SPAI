  "body": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $\\mathfrak{a}\\subseteq R$ be an ideal. For an $R$ -module $M$ , we set $\\Gamma_{\\mathfrak{a}}(M)=\\{x\\in M\\mid\\exists n\\in\\mathbb{N}:\\mathfrak{a}^nx=0\\}$ , and we denote by ${\\rm Ass}_R^{\\rm f}(M)$ the set of weakly associated primes of $M$ . In lots of situations there are interesting relations between $\\Gamma_{\\mathfrak{a}}(M)$ and ${\\rm Ass}_R^{\\rm f}(M)$ , and this question concerns the following two of them: $(*)$ For any $R$ -module $M$ with $\\Gamma_{\\mathfrak{a}}(M)=0$ we have ${\\rm Ass}_R^{\\rm f}(M)\\cap{\\rm Var}(\\mathfrak{a})=\\emptyset$ . $(**)$ For any $R$ -module $M$ with ${\\rm Ass}_R^{\\rm f}(M)\\subseteq{\\rm Var}(\\mathfrak{a})$ we have $\\Gamma_{\\mathfrak{a}}(M)=M$ . If $\\mathfrak{a}$ is of finite type, then both statements are true, but in general neither of them need be so. Moreover, there are examples showing that $(**)$ need not imply $(*)$ . If the functor $\\Gamma_{\\mathfrak{a}}$ is a radical, i.e., if $\\Gamma_{\\mathfrak{a}}(M/\\Gamma_{\\mathfrak{a}}(M))=0$ for every $R$ -module $M$ , then $(*)$ implies $(**)$ . This (and, of course, my inability to find a counterexample) leads to the following question: Does $(*)$ imply $(**)$ in general? ac.commutative-algebra nonnoetherian torsion Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Mar 28, 2017 at 8:17 Fred Rohrer 6,830 1 1 gold badge 28 28 silver badges 47 47 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ By Var$(\\frak a)$, you mean the set of primes that contain $\\frak a$, right? $\\endgroup$ Neil Epstein –  Neil Epstein 2017-03-31 16:47:02 +00:00 Commented Mar 31, 2017 at 16:47 $\\begingroup$ @Neil: Yes.
