  "body": "Given a dimension $n$ and a number $p \\in (0,1)$ , to what extent is it possible (in what cases) to construct a convex set $A$ --not a hypersphere--and a \"snugly\" inscribed ( InscribedFigure ) convex set $B$ , such that (Euclidean) volume(B)= $p$ volume(A)? What if $p$ is rational?

One could start with $H$ outside and move it parallel inward continuously until $p \\, \\textrm{vol}(A)$ is reached. $\\endgroup$ Joseph O'Rourke –  Joseph O'Rourke 2020-08-11 23:08:25 +00:00 Commented Aug 11, 2020 at 23:08 $\\begingroup$ Joseph O'Rourke--that would surely do the trick (though not what I was envisioning). Perhaps I should exempt this possibility --to add a further challenge. $\\endgroup$ Paul B. Slater –  Paul B.

Maybe, it's a little tricky. The term \"snugly\" seems to convey the concept. Perhaps, the relevant idea here is that any similarity transformation of B expanding it, without any translation of B, would yield points outside A. $\\endgroup$ Paul B. Slater –  Paul B.
