  "title": "fa.functional analysis - Any reflexive space has the property of Banach-Saks?",
  "body": "We say that a Banach space $(X,\\|.\\|)$ has the Banach-Saks property if every bounded sequence $(x_m)_m$ in $X$ admits a subsequence $(x_{m_n})_n$ which converges in the sense of Cesàro, that is, there is a vector $x$ in $X$ such that $$ {\\displaystyle \\left \\| {\\frac {\\sum_{n = 1}^{N}x_{m_{n}}}{N}} - x \\right \\| \\underset{N}{\\longrightarrow} 0.} $$ Remark Any Banach space satisfying the Banach-Saks property is reflexive. Question IS the converse implication true, i.e. does every reflexive space satisfy the Banach-Saks property? fa.functional-analysis banach-spaces Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 18, 2020 at 18:12 leo monsaingeon 5,285 2 2 gold badges 26 26 silver badges 51 51 bronze badges asked Jun 18, 2020 at 18:06 Made 115 6 6 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 4 $\\begingroup$ The answer appears to be no, see math.stackexchange.com/a/93881/822 $\\endgroup$ Nate Eldredge –  Nate Eldredge 2020-06-18 18:20:00 +00:00 Commented Jun 18, 2020 at 18:20 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
