  "body": "Let $p_1,\\dots,p_7 \\in \\mathbb P^1 \\times \\mathbb P^1$ be 7 points in general position. What is the number of maps $F=(F_0,F_1):\\mathbb P^1 \\to \\mathbb P^1 \\times \\mathbb P^1$ modulo domain reparametrization for which $F_0$ , $F_1$ are degree 2 and such that the image of $F$ passes through $p_1,\\dots,p_7$ ? ag.algebraic-geometry enumerative-geometry Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jun 29, 2020 at 16:28 Anon 798 3 3 silver badges 11 11 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 1 $\\begingroup$ Can you reduce to the case of $\\mathbb P^2$ by blowing up one of your seven points and then blowing down the two lines through it and adding them to your list of points? I think this will preserve your genericity condition and then you're reduced to cubics on $\\mathbb P^2$. If not, adapting the argument from cubics on $\\mathbb P^2$ with elliptic curves should work. $\\endgroup$ Will Sawin –  Will Sawin 2020-06-29 16:34:11 +00:00 Commented Jun 29, 2020 at 16:34 2 $\\begingroup$ By the \"generalized Riemann-Hurwitz formula\", the number of curves of geometric genus $0$ in a general pencil of $(2,2)$ divisors on $\\mathbb{P}^1\\times \\mathbb{P}^1$ equals the (topological) Euler characteristic of the blowing up of $\\mathbb{P}^1\\times \\mathbb{P}^1$ at the $8$ base points of the pencil, i.e., the number equals $8+2\\times 2 = 12$. $\\endgroup$ Jason Starr –  Jason Starr 2020-06-29 20:55:53 +00:00 Commented Jun 29, 2020 at 20:55 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
