  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - How to show a contraction of singular moduli space is projective?",
  "body": "Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be a certain kind of Hilbert scheme of curves on some smooth projective variety $X$ and $\\mathcal{H}$ is projective and irreducible of dimension $3$ . There is a divisor $\\mathcal{D}\\subset\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ is a ruled surface over a curve $C$ (not necessarily smooth). Let $P\\in C$ be a singular point and let $F$ be the correspondent fiber and $\\mathcal{H}$ is only singular at $F$ . Let $\\pi:\\mathcal{H}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{H}'$ such that $\\pi$ contract $\\mathcal{D}$ to $C\\subset\\mathcal{H}'$ and $\\pi$ is isomorphism outside $\\mathcal{D}$ . What information or property I should know to show that $\\mathcal{H}'$ is also a projective. In the smooth setting, I can try to show that $\\pi$ contracts negative $K_{\\mathcal{H}}$ extremal ray and apply Cone theorem to show $\\mathcal{H}'$ is projective. But now $\\mathcal{H}$ has singularity and I do not know whether the singualr locus being a curve (actually $\\mathbb{P}^1$ in my case) would belong to some class of singularities(say klt, lc,etc) to allow me apply Cone theorem in general. ag.algebraic-geometry moduli-spaces hilbert-schemes minimal-model-program Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Aug 1, 2020 at 18:00 user41650 2,012 13 13 silver badges 23 23 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
