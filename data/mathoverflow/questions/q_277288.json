  "body": "I need to find a cost-optimal 1-factor in a positively weighted, directed, regular graph $G(V,A)$ without antiparallel arcs, i.e. given $$\\text{deg}_{\\text{in}}(u)=\\text{deg}_{\\text{in}}(v)=\\text{deg}_{\\text{out}}(v)=\\text{deg}_{\\text{out}}(u)\\ \\ \\forall u,v\\in V$$ $$a_{ij}\\in G\\implies a_{ji}\\notin G$$ $$c_{ij}:= c(a_{ij}) \\gt 0$$ determine $\\alpha_{ij}\\in\\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace$ , so that $$\\sum_j{\\alpha_{ij}}=\\sum_i{\\alpha_{ij}}=1$$ and $$\\sum{\\alpha_{ij}c_{ij}} = \\text{opt}$$ That problem can be easily solved without the integer constraints via linear programming. It is also possible to solve it via negative cycle cancellation after vertex splitting. Question: can the above problem be solved without linear programming and without vertex splitting, using one of the graph theoretic algorithms for mincost flows? graph-theory algorithms linear-programming Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Jul 26, 2017 at 5:53 Manfred Weis 14k 4 4 gold badges 40 40 silver badges 82 82 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
