  "body": "For Fibonacci numbers $F_n$ it holds that $p|F_{p-(\\frac{5}{p})}$ , if $p$ is an odd prime (Legendre symbol). I guessed that the number $5$ came from the roots of the characteristic polynomial and tried the following approach: Given $a,b\\in\\mathbb Z^+$ (for simplicity), and let $F_{a,b}:\\mathbb N\\to\\mathbb N$ be a function such that $F_{a,b}(0)=0$ , $F_{a,b}(1)=1$ and $F_{a,b}(n+1)=a\\cdot F_{a,b}(n)+b\\cdot F_{a,b}(n-1)$ . Conjecture: If $a,b$ are co-prime and $p>2$ is a prime that doesn't divide $b$ , then $F_{a,b}\\left(p-\\left(\\frac{a^2+4b}{p}\\right)\\right)\\equiv 0\\pmod p$ , Is this conjecture correct and known? I have tested the conjecture with $50000$ randomly selected $a,b,p$ . That is, three numbers $1\\le a',b'\\le 100$ and $3\\le p'\\le 10000$ are selected with uniform distribution, then $a=\\frac{a'}{gcd(a',b')},b=\\frac{b'}{gcd(a',b')}$ and $p$ is set to the least prime $\\ge p'$ . reference-request prime-numbers recurrences conjectures Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Feb 17, 2017 at 10:56 Lehs 862 9 9 silver badges 18 18 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 3 $\\begingroup$ Your sequence is a Lucas sequence of the first kind. Your conjecture is true and well known. It is listed under \"Other Relations\" here: en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_sequence . $\\endgroup$ Ofir Gorodetsky –  Ofir Gorodetsky 2017-02-17 13:03:03 +00:00 Commented Feb 17, 2017 at 13:03 $\\begingroup$ @OfirGorodetsky. Yes, I found it. But the condition of the conjecture is not as hard $p\\nmid b$ and on Wikipedia $p\\nmid ab(a^2+4b)$. So far I have not found a counter-example of the condition in the conjecture. $\\endgroup$ Lehs –  Lehs 2017-02-17 15:08:58 +00:00 Commented Feb 17, 2017 at 15:08 $\\begingroup$ The other conditions in the Wikipedia page are redundant, the proof does not require them. Your conditions suffice. I suspect that even requiring $a,b$ to be coprime is redundant. $\\endgroup$ Ofir Gorodetsky –  Ofir Gorodetsky 2017-02-17 23:42:28 +00:00 Commented Feb 17, 2017 at 23:42 $\\begingroup$ @OfirGorodetsky, you seems to be right. The co-prime condition was a faulty intuition: I immediately saw that there was something in the $a^2+4b$ but that some conditions was necessary. I have tested without the co-prime condition and with negative $b$ ($a^2>4b$) and the only necessary condition seems to be that $p$ shouldn't divide $b$. $\\endgroup$ Lehs –  Lehs 2017-02-18 07:20:50 +00:00 Commented Feb 18, 2017 at 7:20 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
