  "title": "mp.mathematical physics - Gibbs distribution as a pushfoward",
  "body": "Let $\\Omega_{0}:=\\{-1,1\\}$ be a single spin space. If $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ is a fixed finite set, take $\\mathcal{F}_{0}$ to be the $\\sigma$ -algebra $2^{\\Omega_{0}}$ on $\\Omega_{0}$ . We define $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} :=\\{-1,1\\}^{\\Lambda}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}$ to be the associate product $\\sigma$ -algebra, i.e. $\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda} = 2^{\\Omega_{\\Lambda}}$ . Moreover, take $\\Omega:= \\Omega_{0}^{\\mathbb{Z}^{d}}$ and $\\mathcal{F} := 2^{\\Omega}$ . If $\\eta \\in \\Omega$ , we can define the Hamiltonian for ferromagnetic models $\\mathcal{H}_{\\Lambda,h, \\eta}:\\Omega_{\\Lambda}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ to be: $$H_{\\Lambda,h,\\eta}(\\omega_{\\Lambda}) := -\\sum_{x,y \\in \\Lambda}J(x,y)\\omega_{x}\\omega_{y}-\\sum_{x\\in \\Lambda}\\bigg{(}h+\\sum_{y\\in \\Lambda^{c}}J(x,y)\\eta_{y}\\bigg{)}\\omega_{x} $$ Here, $J=J(x,y)$ are coupling strenghts which are assumed to be non-negative and translation invariant. The above defined Hamiltonian is often referred as the Hamiltonian with boundary condition $\\eta$ . Suppose $\\nu_{0}$ is a counting measure on $\\Omega_{0}$ given by $\\nu_{0}(\\emptyset)=0$ , $\\nu_{0}(\\{\\pm 1\\}) = 1/2$ . Take $\\nu_{\\Lambda}$ to be its associate product measure. The finite volume Gibbs state $\\mu_{\\Lambda,\\beta, h, \\eta}$ is a probability measure on $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ defined to be: $$\\mu_{\\Lambda,\\beta,h,\\eta}(A) := \\frac{1}{Z_{\\Lambda, \\beta, h, \\eta}}\\int_{A}e^{-\\beta H_{\\Lambda,h,\\eta}(\\omega_{\\Lambda})}d\\nu_{\\Lambda}(\\omega_{\\Lambda})$$ where $\\beta > 0$ is the inverse absolute temperature and $Z_{\\Lambda,\\beta,h,\\eta}$ is a normalization constant called the partition function. Now, as discussed in Friedli & Velenik's book (see chapter 3, page 81) it is convenient to extend some of the above definitions to subspaces of $\\Omega$ . Thus, let $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}^{\\eta}:=\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega: \\hspace{0.1cm} \\mbox{$\\omega_{x}=\\eta_{x}$ if $x \\in \\Lambda^{c}$}\\}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}^{\\eta}$ to be the $\\sigma$ -algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}^{\\eta} = 2^{\\Omega_{\\Lambda}^{\\eta}}$ on it. We define the Gibbs state $\\mu_{\\Lambda,\\beta, h}^{\\eta}$ on $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}^{\\eta}$ by its evaluation on singletons: $$\\mu_{\\Lambda,\\beta,h}^{\\eta}(\\{\\omega\\}) = \\frac{1}{Z_{\\Lambda,\\beta,h}^{\\eta}}e^{-\\beta H_{\\Lambda,h}^{\\eta}(\\omega)}$$ where, here $H_{\\Lambda, h}^{\\eta}(\\omega) := H_{\\Lambda,h,\\eta}(\\Omega_{\\Lambda})$ with $\\omega_{\\Lambda}$ being the projection of $\\omega$ to $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ and $Z_{\\Lambda,\\beta,h}^{\\eta}$ the new normalizing constant. Question: Is $\\mu_{\\Lambda, \\beta,h}^{\\eta}$ just the pushfoward of $\\mu_{\\Lambda,\\beta,h,\\eta}$ ? In other words, consider the injection $i_{\\eta}: \\Omega_{\\Lambda}\\to \\Omega_{\\Lambda}^{\\eta}$ given by $i_{\\eta}(\\omega_{\\Lambda}) = \\omega_{\\Lambda}|\\eta_{\\Lambda^{c}}$ where $\\omega_{\\Lambda}|\\eta_{\\Lambda^{c}}$ is the sequence $\\sigma$ on $\\Omega$ with $\\sigma_{x}=\\omega_{x}$ if $x\\in \\Lambda$ and $\\sigma_{x} = \\eta_{x}$ otherwise. Is it true that $\\mu_{\\Lambda,\\beta,h}^{\\eta}(A) = \\mu_{\\Lambda,\\beta,h,\\eta}(i_{\\eta}^{-1}(A))$ ? See, I think this is true because it seems these two measures coincide on singletons, but I might be misunderstanding something. ADD: I think I should elaborate my question a little more. If these two measures agree on singletons, they surely will agree on all $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ since this set is finite. The point is that I don't know for sure if these measures indeed agree on singletons. But let me elaborate the reasoning that led me to this belief. Because $\\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}=2^{\\Omega}$ , every singleton is measurable. Thus, take a singleton $\\{\\omega_{\\Lambda}\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\Lambda}$ . Then, because $\\nu_{\\Lambda}$ is a counting measure, we have: \\begin{eqnarray} \\mu_{\\Lambda, \\beta, h,\\eta}(i_{\\eta}^{-1}(\\{\\omega\\})) = \\mu_{\\Lambda,\\beta,h\\eta}(\\{\\omega_{\\Lambda}\\}) = \\frac{1}{Z_{\\Lambda,\\beta,h,\\eta}}e^{-\\beta H_{\\Lambda, h,\\eta}(\\omega_{\\Lambda})} = \\frac{e^{-\\beta H_{\\Lambda, h,\\eta}(\\omega_{\\Lambda})}}{\\sum_{\\omega_{\\Lambda}\\in \\Omega_{\\Lambda}}e^{-\\beta H_{\\Lambda, h,\\eta}(\\omega_{\\Lambda})}} = \\frac{e^{-\\beta H_{\\Lambda, h}^{\\eta}(\\omega_{\\Lambda})}}{\\sum_{\\omega \\in \\Omega_{\\Lambda}^{\\eta}}e^{-\\beta H_{\\Lambda,h}^{\\eta}(\\omega)}} = \\mu_{\\Lambda,\\beta,h}^{\\eta}(\\{\\omega\\}) \\end{eqnarray} mp.mathematical-physics statistical-physics Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 13, 2020 at 14:31 asked Jul 11, 2020 at 20:07 MathMath 1,465 9 9 silver badges 21 21 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 6 1 $\\begingroup$ If two measures on a finite set agree on singletons, doesn’t that mean they’re equal? $\\endgroup$ Anthony Quas –  Anthony Quas 2020-07-12 20:22:59 +00:00 Commented Jul 12, 2020 at 20:22 $\\begingroup$ @AnthonyQuas it surely does. Maybe my post was not entirely clear on this. The point is that I think but I don't know for sure that these measures agree on singletons.

Which point of view is more convenient depends on the application (for instance, in Chapter 6 of our book, the second point of view is better suited for the analysis; in Chapter 8, the first point of view turns out to be more convenient; in Chapter 3, both could be used equally easily). As you notice, it is very simple to go from one to the other. $\\endgroup$ Yvan Velenik –  Yvan Velenik 2020-07-13 16:41:29 +00:00 Commented Jul 13, 2020 at 16:41 $\\begingroup$ @YvanVelenik great!

In general, your sigma-algebras should be Borel sigma-algebras for suitable topologies. For finite sets like $\\Omega_0$ or $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ the correct topology is the discrete one. But when considering $\\Omega$, you should take the product topology coming from the discrete one on the factors $\\{-1,1\\}$. Then $\\mathcal{F}$ should be the Borel sigma-algebra for this product topology. $\\endgroup$ Abdelmalek Abdesselam –  Abdelmalek Abdesselam 2020-07-13 21:37:21 +00:00 Commented Jul 13, 2020 at 21:37  |  Show 1 more comment 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
