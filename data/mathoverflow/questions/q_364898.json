  "body": "In this paper Corvaja and Zannier considered the following problem. Let $K$ be a number field, and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $K$ containing the infinite places and let $\\mathcal{O}_S$ be its ring of $S$ -integers. One may enlarge $S$ so that $\\mathcal{O}_S$ is a PID. Suppose that $f_i, g_i$ are polynomials in $\\mathcal{O}_S[x,y]$ for $i = 1,2,3$ . Then they showed (see Theorem 2) that under certain genericness assumptions that the set of points $(x,y) \\in \\mathcal{O}_S^2$ satisfying $$\\displaystyle f_i(x,y) | g_i(x,y), i = 1,2,3$$ is not Zariski dense. Moreover, they showed that none of the assumptions they made can be dropped. In particular, there are easy counter-examples when $i = 1,2$ . In my situation, I wish to consider a variant of this problem in the case $i = 2$ . Take single variable polynomials $f(x), g(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and a polynomial $q(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ . What can we say about the number of integral points $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$ with $\\max\\{|x|, |y|\\} \\leq T$ such that $$\\displaystyle q(x,y) | \\gcd(f(x), g(y))?$$ Can any aspect of Corjava-Zannier be applied in this setting, and if not, are there any other methods to count such points? nt.number-theory algebraic-number-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 5, 2020 at 14:45 Stanley Yao Xiao ♦ 31k 7 7 gold badges 63 63 silver badges 173 173 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
