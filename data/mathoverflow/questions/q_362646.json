  "title": "co.combinatorics - Is there a characterization for the finite sequences of natural numbers which are the shifts of a permutation?",
  "body": "Given a natural number $k<n$ and a permutation $\\sigma\\in S_n$ , I will call $k$ a shift of $\\sigma$ if there is some $m$ with $\\sigma(m)-m\\equiv k \\mod n$ . If one is given a sequence $s=(x_1,...,x_n)$ of $n$ natural numbers between $0$ and $n-1$ , is there some known way to determine whether $s$ represents the shifts of some permutatuon in $S_n$ ? If not, I am also interested in relevant heuristics.

But the question here is slightly different, because here one of the permutations is assumed to be the identity. Does the same result still apply? $\\endgroup$ Sam Hopkins –  Sam Hopkins ♦ 2020-06-11 17:22:23 +00:00 Commented Jun 11, 2020 at 17:22 $\\begingroup$ @SamHopkins Yes; if $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ are two permutations with prescribed differences, then $\\sigma\\tau^{-1}$ is a permutation with the same multiset of shifts. $\\endgroup$ Ilya Bogdanov –  Ilya Bogdanov 2020-06-11 19:22:11 +00:00 Commented Jun 11, 2020 at 19:22 $\\begingroup$ @IlyaBogdanov: yes, but it was unclear to me whether the question was about multisets of shifts or sequences of shifts. $\\endgroup$ Sam Hopkins –  Sam Hopkins ♦ 2020-06-11 19:45:47 +00:00 Commented Jun 11, 2020 at 19:45 1 $\\begingroup$ @SamHopkins Well, for a sequence it is rather trivial, isn’t it? The characterization is ‘$x_i+i$ are pairwise distinct module $n$’... $\\endgroup$ Ilya Bogdanov –  Ilya Bogdanov 2020-06-11 19:50:18 +00:00 Commented Jun 11, 2020 at 19:50  |  Show 1 more comment 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
