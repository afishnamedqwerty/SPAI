  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - Galois action of Weil restriction",
  "body": "Let $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ be a quadratic field. Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $K$ but not over $\\mathbb{Q}$ , and let $\\bar{E}$ be the Galois conjugate of $E$ . Then by the descent theory (for instance, see section h ), we can construct an abelian surface $A:=Res_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(E)$ , which is isomorphic to $E\\times \\bar{E}$ over $K$ (but not like to be over $\\mathbb{Q}$ ). With this setup, my question is: Knowing the $Gal(\\overline{K}/K)$ -action attached to the Tate module $T_{\\ell}(E)$ , how to compute the $Gal(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}/\\mathbb{Q})$ -action attached to the Etale cohomology $H^2_{et}(A, \\mathbb{Q}_{\\ell})$ ? For instance, given a good prime $p$ of $A$ (i.e. the reduction of $A$ at $p$ is still smooth), then what is the trace of Frobenius $p$ at $H^2_{et}(A, \\mathbb{Q}_{\\ell})$ ? In particular, if there is an isogeny from $E$ to $\\bar{E}$ , can we understand the transcendental part of $H^2_{et}(A,\\mathbb{Q}_{\\ell})$ as symmetric square of $T_{\\ell}(E)$ ? I apolgies if the question is too complicated. Any suggestion or reference is welcome.

The $H^1$ for $A$ is the dual of its Tate module, and $H^2(A)=\\wedge^2 H^1(A)$. $\\endgroup$ anon –  anon 2020-06-19 07:41:00 +00:00 Commented Jun 19, 2020 at 7:41 $\\begingroup$ Thanks @anon, I think you are right. It's kind of embarring that I didn't realize that the induced representation is the answer. $\\endgroup$ Leo D –  Leo D 2020-06-20 23:29:25 +00:00 Commented Jun 20, 2020 at 23:29 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
