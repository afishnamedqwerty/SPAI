  "title": "dg.differential geometry - Why $h_t$ maps into $\\mathbb{R}^{\\nu}$?",
  "body": "I am studying geometric measure theory ( Herbert Federer - Geometric measure theory ) and I have a question about class $r$ homotopies. Here's the definition, from p. 363, Section 4.1.9: Suppose $U$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ , $V$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{v}$ $f$ , and $g$ are functions mapping $U$ into $V$ . A homotopy of class $r$ from $f$ to $g$ is a map $$ h: A \\times U \\rightarrow V $$ of class $r$ such that $A$ is an open subinterval of $\\mathbb{R}$ , $0 \\in A$ , $1 \\in A$ , $$ h(0, x)=f(x) \\text { and } h(1, x)=g(x) \\text { for } x \\in U. $$ Whenever $t \\in A$ we define $$ h_{t}: U \\rightarrow V, \\quad h_{t}(x)=h(t, x) \\text { for } x \\in U, $$ hence $h_{0}=f$ and $h_{1}=g$ ; in case $r \\geq 1$ we also define $$ h_{t}: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{v}, \\quad h_{t}(x)=\\langle(1,0), D h(t, x)\\rangle \\text { for } x \\in U, $$ hence $\\langle(v, w), D h(t, x)\\rangle=v h_{t}(x)+\\left\\langle w, D h_{t}(x)\\right\\rangle$ for $t \\in A$ , $x \\in U$ , $v \\in \\mathbb{R}$ , $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ . Now my question is about the last 3 lines: in case $r \\geq 1$ we also define $$ h_{t}: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{v}, \\quad h_{t}(x)=\\langle(1,0), D h(t, x)\\rangle \\text { for } x \\in U, $$ hence $\\langle(v, w), D h(t, x)\\rangle=v h_{t}(x)+\\left\\langle w, D h_{t}(x)\\right\\rangle$ for $t \\in A, x \\in U, v \\in \\mathbb{R}, w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ . Actually, we know that $\\langle v, Df(a)\\rangle = v \\cdot \\nabla f(a)$ . Also, in the last line it is mentioned that $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ , hence $0 = (0, \\dotsc,0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ . Now, we have: $$h_t(x)= \\langle (1, 0, \\dotsc, 0), Dh(t,x) \\rangle$$ which is equal to \\begin{align} h_t(x) &= (1, 0, \\dotsc, 0) \\cdot \\nabla h(t,x)\\\\ &= (1, 0 , \\dotsc, 0) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}, \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x_1}, \\dotsc, \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x_n}\\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}.\\end{align} Now, my question is that why it is said that $h_t: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{\\nu}$ ? I mean, now we should see that $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\nu}$ , but I don't get it really! If this is just the differential of $h$ , it must lie in $\\mathbb{R}^{\\nu-1}$ ! dg.differential-geometry geometric-measure-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 31, 2020 at 13:52 asked Jul 31, 2020 at 11:58 Zeno cosini 161 2 2 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 8 1 $\\begingroup$ The partial derivative at $t \\in A$ of a map $h : A \\times U \\to V \\subseteq \\mathbb R^\\nu$ is a map $U \\to \\mathbb R^\\nu$; what is the question? (What I don't get is what it means to define $h_t$ twice, on the same domain, in two completely different ways ….) $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-07-31 12:21:53 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 12:21 $\\begingroup$ Perhaps the point is that the notation is unclear, and looks like an inner product, whereas I think the significance is that $Dh(t, x)$ is a map $\\mathbb R \\times \\mathbb R^n \\to \\mathbb R^\\nu$, and all we are doing is applying it to the vector $(1, 0) \\in \\mathbb R \\times \\mathbb R^n$. (One could think of this as matrix-vector multiplication.) $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-07-31 12:29:27 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 12:29 $\\begingroup$ Thank you so much @LSpice. Well, as I saw in the book, the definition of the $\\langle -,-\\rangle$ is exactly as I wrote and it'll be the inner product of the vector $v=(0,1) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\nabla h(t,x)$. What I don't understand is that why this inner product lies in $\\mathbb{R}^\\nu$! I mean, in the definition, it is said that $h$ lies in $\\mathbb{R}^\\nu$. So, as $h_t = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}$, shouldn't it lie in $\\mathbb{R}^{\\nu -1}$? $\\endgroup$ Zeno cosini –  Zeno cosini 2020-07-31 12:48:11 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 12:48 1 $\\begingroup$ I'm not sure why you would expect the partial derivative of an $\\mathbb R^\\nu$-valued function to be $\\mathbb R^{\\nu - 1}$-valued; partial derivatives in some sense \"reduce input variables\", not \"reduce output variables\". Anyway, the 'definition' of $\\langle{-}, {-}\\rangle$ in terms of the gradient that you mention I guess is the one on p. 209, where it is specified only for $Y = \\mathbb R$, so that evaluation is the inner product. For more general $Y$, one can only think of evaluation. $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-07-31 13:27:29 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 13:27 1 $\\begingroup$ Yes, you're right @LSpice . I edited the title, thanks for that. About the definition of that product so, how can we define it? I didn't find any definitions and since I'm really new to this topic, I am really confused. $\\endgroup$ Zeno cosini –  Zeno cosini 2020-07-31 13:52:24 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 13:52  |  Show 3 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
