  "body": "Given an integer $m>0$ possibly composite we can find non-negative integers which are not equivalent to $0\\bmod m$ with $$ab+cd\\equiv0\\bmod m$$ . Is there any integer quadruples bounded in $[0,m-1]^4$ are there that also satisfy $$bd-ac\\equiv0\\bmod m$$ $$a^2+d^2=e^2$$ $$b^2+c^2=f^2$$ for some integers $0<e,f\\leq\\sqrt m$ ? If $(a,d,e)$ and $(b,c,f)$ are primitive Pythagorean triples then $a,b$ are of form $2m'$ are $d,c$ are of form $m'^2-1$ and $e,f$ are of form $m ^2+1$ . So there are only two integers $m_1$ and $m_2$ that parameterize $a,d$ and $b,c$ respectively with $$bd=2m_1(m_2^2-1)$$ $$ac=2m_2(m_1^2-1)$$ $$ab=4m_1m_2$$ $$cd=(m_1^2-1)(m_2^2-1)$$ and we seek $$4m_1m_2+(m_1^2-1)(m_2^2-1)\\equiv0\\bmod m$$ $$2m_1(m_2^2-1)-2m_2(m_1^2-1)\\equiv0\\bmod m.$$ We also have $$\\begin{bmatrix}a&d\\\\d&-a\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}b\\\\c\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}b&c\\\\-c&b\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}a\\\\d\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\ell m\\\\\\ell'm\\end{bmatrix}$$ at some integers with $\\ell\\ell'\\neq0$ . nt.number-theory co.combinatorics analytic-number-theory arithmetic-geometry pythagorean-triples Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 16, 2020 at 5:02 asked Jul 16, 2020 at 4:47 VS. 1,846 1 1 gold badge 12 12 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
