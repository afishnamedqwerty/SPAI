  "body": "Let $X$ be a normal, projective, integral variety (over $\\mathbb{C}$ ) and $P$ be the Picard variety parametrizing invertible sheaves on $X$ . Does there exist a compactification $\\overline{P}$ of $P$ along with an universal family $\\mathcal{U}$ defined over $X \\times \\overline{P}$ , flat over $\\overline{P}$ , parametrizing the space of rank $1$ , torsion-free sheaves on $X$ (probably with a fixed Hilbert polynomial)?

This was proved by Grothendieck in FGA, see Kleiman's survey article \"The Picard scheme\". $\\endgroup$ Piotr Achinger –  Piotr Achinger 2020-06-22 20:30:29 +00:00 Commented Jun 22, 2020 at 20:30 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
