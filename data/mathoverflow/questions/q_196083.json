  "title": "graph theory - When does a &quot;stable&quot; assignment of buyers into goods exist?",
  "body": "Consider a setting of $n$ buyers and $m$ goods. We have a value matrix $V\\in[0,1]^{n\\times m}$ specifying how much each buyer values each good (everything is open information here and there is no actual bidding involved). We may assume all of the entries in $V$ are distinct. An assignment is a function $A:[n]\\to [m]$ . Denote $A^{-1}(j)=\\{i\\in[n]:A(i)=j\\}$ . Each good is then divided equally amongst the buyers it is assigned to, which value the good within $r$ factor of the highest valuation. A stable assignment is an assignment where no player would benefit from deviating from it to a different good (i.e. the current good assigned to him is in his best-response). Next I'll write it mathematically, but this paragraphs pretty much says it all. For an assignment $A$ , and a good $j\\in[m]$ , define by $c_j$ the maximum valuation of a user assigned to $j$ and by $B_j$ the set of buyers which value the good at most $r\\cdot c_j$ , i.e. $$c_j = \\max_{i\\in A^{-1}(j)} V_{i,j}$$ $$B_j = \\{i\\in [n]: V_{i,j}\\geq r\\cdot c_j\\}$$ An $r$ -stable (for some $r\\in(0,1]$ ) assignment is a function $A:[n]\\to [m]$ such that: Each player $i$ , earns $U_i=\\frac{V_{i,A(i)}}{|B_{A(i)}\\cap A^{-1}(A(i))|}$ if $i\\in B_{A(i)}$ or $0$ otherwise. No buyer has an incentive to \"deviate\" to a different good (in which he would get a positive payoff), i.e. if a buyer $i$ got a payoff of $x$ , then: $$\\forall i\\in[n], j:i\\in B_j:x\\geq \\frac{V_{i,j}}{|B_j\\cap A^{-1}(j)|+1}$$ The questions are: Is there always a $r$ -stable assignment (for every values of $r$ and $V$ )? If we remove the \"deviation\" requirement (the second one), how much better could we be, in terms of the sum of payoffs to the buyers? Notice that the special case of $r=1$ can be solved somewhat easily: Consider a bipartite graph, where the buyers on one side and the goods on the other. Run the greedy maximum weight matching algorithm (every time, match the maximum value buyer-good pair such that neither the buyer or the good were matched yet). This gives a $1$ -stable assignment and it provides a $2$ -approximation to the optimal maximum weight matching which does not consider the \"deviation\" constraint. graph-theory algorithms game-theory matching-theory existence-theorems Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Feb 9, 2015 at 13:07 R B 638 3 3 silver badges 20 20 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 1 $\\begingroup$ For $m<n$ there is no 1-stable assignment.

Will edit the question shortly. $\\endgroup$ R B –  R B 2015-02-09 13:48:42 +00:00 Commented Feb 9, 2015 at 13:48 1 $\\begingroup$ @user35593 - actually, in my application I allow $m\\geq n$, but if a user valuation is less than $r$ times the highest valuation, he gets payoff of $0$. Wondering what would be the best way to write it. $\\endgroup$ R B –  R B 2015-02-09 13:52:55 +00:00 Commented Feb 9, 2015 at 13:52 $\\begingroup$ @user35593 - I've edited the question. The case of $n>m$ is allowed, but $n-m$ buyers would then get utility of $0$ (and will have no incentive to deviate). $\\endgroup$ R B –  R B 2015-02-09 15:07:04 +00:00 Commented Feb 9, 2015 at 15:07 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
