  "body": "For $i+j+k=N$ , consider the permutation $\\Pi_{i,j,k}\\in S_N$ , which keeps the numbers $0,\\ldots,i-1$ fixed, and exchanges the numbers $i,\\ldots,i+j-1$ with the numbers $i+j,\\ldots,i+j+k-1$ . $$\\Pi_{i,j,k}(x)= \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if}\\quad 0\\leq x<i\\\\ x+k&\\text{if}\\quad i\\leq x<i+j\\\\ x-j&\\text{if}\\quad i+j\\leq x<i+j+k \\end{cases} $$ $i=0$ is allowed. Rather obviously, $\\Pi_{i,j,k}$ for different $i,j,k$ generate the whole symmetric group $S_N$ . Is there simple set of relations for those generators, such that $S_N$ is the free group over the $\\Pi_{i,j,k}$ modulo those relations? co.combinatorics gr.group-theory finite-groups free-groups Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 28, 2020 at 13:07 Andi Bauer 3,105 9 9 silver badges 18 18 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 $\\begingroup$ I'm talking about relations like $\\Pi_{0,i,j+k+l}\\Pi_{j,k,i+l}\\Pi_{0,k+j+l,i}\\Pi_{i+k,j,l}=\\Pi_{i,j+k,l}$ (for all $i$, $j$, $k$, $l$). $\\endgroup$ Andi Bauer –  Andi Bauer 2020-07-28 15:18:07 +00:00 Commented Jul 28, 2020 at 15:18 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
