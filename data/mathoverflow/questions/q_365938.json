  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - Is the fiber product of two connected complex varieties over a connected base connected?",
  "body": "If $X,Y,Z$ are connected varieties over $\\mathbb{C}$ , with morphisms $X\\rightarrow Z, Y\\rightarrow Z$ , is it true that the fiber product $X\\times _Z Y$ is connected? The statement is true for $S=Spec(\\mathbb{C})$ , but I can't see it for general $S$ . Any help would be appreciated. ag.algebraic-geometry Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 18, 2020 at 14:22 Hajime_Saito 777 3 3 silver badges 7 7 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 9 4 $\\begingroup$ Try $X,Y,Z$ all equal to $\\mathbb{C}^*$ and the morphisms $z\\mapsto z^2$. $\\endgroup$ Mohan –  Mohan 2020-07-18 14:36:48 +00:00 Commented Jul 18, 2020 at 14:36 3 $\\begingroup$ Whenever $X \\to Y$ is a finite étale Galois cover of degree $d > 1$, the fibre product $X \\times_Y X$ splits up as a disjoint union of $d$ sheets. This can happen for smooth projective varieties as well, e.g. the multiplication by $n$ map $E \\to E$ on an elliptic curve (say $n$ invertible in $k$). $\\endgroup$ R. van Dobben de Bruyn –  R. van Dobben de Bruyn 2020-07-18 14:53:01 +00:00 Commented Jul 18, 2020 at 14:53 2 $\\begingroup$ In light of the above comments, it may be more interesting to ask: if $Z$ is connected and $X\\to Z$ and $Y\\to Z$ have connected fibers is the fiber product connected? $\\endgroup$ cgodfrey –  cgodfrey 2020-07-18 15:29:54 +00:00 Commented Jul 18, 2020 at 15:29 2 $\\begingroup$ This is ok when $X \\to Z$ (resp. $Y \\to Z$) is proper with geometrically connected fibres. Indeed, apply Tag 0377 to the proper map $X \\times_Z Y \\to Y$ (resp. $X \\times_Z Y \\to X$), which is a topological quotient since it is proper. (A similar argument can be made if you replace 'proper' by 'universally open', e.g. flat of finite presentation.) $\\endgroup$ R. van Dobben de Bruyn –  R. van Dobben de Bruyn 2020-07-18 16:23:04 +00:00 Commented Jul 18, 2020 at 16:23 1 $\\begingroup$ @yojusmath: It is better to ask this in a separate question. $\\endgroup$ Sasha –  Sasha 2020-07-18 16:31:06 +00:00 Commented Jul 18, 2020 at 16:31  |  Show 4 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
