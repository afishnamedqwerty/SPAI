  "body": "Cipolla's algorithm for computing square roots in a finite field ( Wikipedia ) requires finding $x$ such that $x^2 - a$ is not a square (for computing a square root of $a$ ). The usual way to do this is to try random values of $x$ until one verifies this condition. What about trying $x = 0, 1, 2, ...$ (assuming the field is $GF(p)$ for prime $p$ )? What is known about the smallest integer that verifies the condition (possibly assuming GRH)? In Tonelli–Shanks' algorithm, we would instead be looking for $y$ that is not a square, and assuming GRH one can prove that the smallest such $y$ in $O(\\log(p)^2)$ (even $\\leq 2 \\log(p)^2$ IIRC, this is due to Bach and can be found in Prime Numbers A Computational Perspective by Crandall and Pomerance). Without GRH, some much weaker bounds are available ( $O(p^{1/2})$ is easy IIRC). My question is whether a similar bound is known for the variant of Cipolla's algorithm that I described above. Note that I'm not asking whether it is advisable to implement the algorithm like this. Selecting $x$ randomly is certainly easy enough and theoretically well grounded. However, this question seems natural to me. I'm pretty sure that no good (meaning, polynomial in $\\log(p)$ ) bound is known without GRH, since it would yield a simple, fully deterministic, polynomial time, algorithm for computing square roots in finite fields, and this would be widely known. I tried reducing my question to Bach's result, but got stuck. If $z^2 = a$ , then $x^2 - a$ is a square iff $x = z$ or $\\frac{x + z}{x - z}$ is a square, and $f: x \\mapsto \\frac{x + z}{x - z}$ is a bijection on the projective line. This makes it easy to get a probability for a random $x$ to verify the condition, but $f(x)$ is not necessarily \"small\" when $x$ is, so I can't relate this to Bach's. nt.number-theory algorithms Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 27, 2020 at 16:48 U1F419 31 1 1 bronze badge $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
