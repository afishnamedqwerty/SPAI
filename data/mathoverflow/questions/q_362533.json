  "title": "gr.group theory - Character table of the symmetric group $S_n$ according to James",
  "body": "In James, \"The representation theory of the symmetric groups\" an algorithm is described to produce the character table of a symmetric group. The proof involves the equation (pp. 22,23) $$\\lvert S_\\lambda\\rvert \\lvert S_\\nu\\rvert \\langle \\text{ind}_{S_\\lambda}^{S_n} 1_{S_\\lambda}, \\text{ind}_{S_\\mu}^{S_n} 1_{S_\\mu}\\rangle = \\sum_{\\mu} \\frac{n!}{\\lvert S_\\mu \\rvert} \\lvert S_\\lambda \\cap S_\\mu \\rvert \\lvert S_\\nu \\cap S_\\mu\\rvert$$ which is verified by first applying Frobenius reciprocity and then getting to the intermediate (apparently equal) term $$\\lvert S_{\\lambda} \\rvert \\sum_{\\mu} \\text{ind}_{S_\\lambda}^{S^n}(g^\\mu) \\lvert S_\\nu \\cap S_\\mu \\rvert$$ (where $g^\\mu$ is some element of type $\\mu$ ). Looking at James, Kerber, \"The representation theory of the symmetric group\" I find that this part of the statement is removed and instead there is a general discussion about the values of $\\langle \\text{ind}_{S_\\lambda}^{S_n} 1_{S_\\lambda}, \\text{ind}_{S_\\mu}^{S_n} 1_{S_\\mu}\\rangle$ . Could someone explain to me, what the status of those few lines in the first book is? Is it easy and I'm just missing something easy? Or does it in fact use more machinery than is available at that point? Edit: a formulation of the question that does not involve characters is how to see $$\\lvert S_\\lambda \\backslash S_n / S_\\nu \\rvert = \\frac{\\lvert S_n \\rvert}{\\lvert S_\\lambda \\rvert \\lvert S_\\nu \\rvert }\\sum_{\\mu} \\frac{1}{\\lvert S_\\mu \\rvert} \\lvert S_\\lambda \\cap S_\\mu \\rvert \\lvert S_\\nu \\cap S_\\mu \\rvert\\text{.}$$ Edit2: I think he is saying that $\\lvert (g^\\mu)^{S_n} \\cap S_\\nu \\rvert = \\lvert S_\\mu \\cap S_\\nu \\rvert$ (the first is the conjugacy class of $g^\\mu$ in $S_n$ ). Solution: In the end this is about handwriting: James writes a gothic S for the symmetric groups and a curly C for conjugacy classes. Just, both of these are little squiggles and I only realize now that they are supposed to be distinct. So every $S_\\mu$ has to be a $C_\\mu = (g^{\\mu})^{S_n}$ . I apologize to everyone who spent time on this! P.S: James himself gets confused about this: The fraction $n!/\\lvert C_\\mu \\rvert$ is the order of the centralizer of $g^\\mu$ so the denominator has to be $C_\\mu$ rather than $S_\\mu$ . However, what James writes is very clearly (once you get sensitive to the distinction) an $S_\\mu$ . gr.group-theory rt.representation-theory finite-groups symmetric-groups characters Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 16, 2020 at 8:13 asked Jun 8, 2020 at 18:13 Stefan Witzel 2,070 13 13 silver badges 26 26 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 12 $\\begingroup$ Is Mackey's formula mentioned in the intermediate lines? $\\endgroup$ Geoff Robinson –  Geoff Robinson 2020-06-08 18:25:48 +00:00 Commented Jun 8, 2020 at 18:25 $\\begingroup$ No, that's the thing. It appears that it should be used but he specifically does not. He applies Frobenius reciprocity (which would also be the first step toward Mackey) but then he writes the resulting scalar product out with $1_{S_\\mu}$ as a sum.
