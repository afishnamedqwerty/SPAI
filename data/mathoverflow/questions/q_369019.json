  "title": "gr.group theory - Existence of inner twisting preserve the $*$ action on simple roots",
  "body": "I've been trying to learn the theory of inner and outer Galois twisting in algebraic groups. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic 0, and let $k^s$ be a separable closure. Let $G$ be a connected semisimple group over $k$ . Then it is an inner $k$ -form of some $k$ -quasisplit group, say $G'$ . There is an isomorphism $f:G \\rightarrow G'$ defined over $k^s$ such that for all $\\gamma$ in the Galois group $\\Gamma(k^s/k)$ of $k^s/k$ , we have $f^{-1} \\cdot\\, ^\\gamma\\! f \\in \\text{Int}(G)$ . Choose a Borel subgroup $B$ of $G$ (resp. $B'$ of $G'$ ) and a maximal torus $T$ (resp. $T'$ ) of $B$ (resp. $B'$ ), all defined over $k^s$ . Let $\\Delta$ and $\\Delta'$ be the set of simple roots of $(G,T)_{k^s}$ and $(G',T')_{k^s}$ . The Galois group $\\Gamma(k^s/k)$ acts on each of these via the $*$ -action. In the case of $G'$ , since $G'$ is quasisplit, the $*$ -action is just the standard action on the character lattice. Let $\\rho$ be a bijection from the set of orbits in $\\Delta$ onto the set of orbits in $\\Delta'$ . Question: Does there exist an isomorphism $f:G \\rightarrow G'$ defined over $k^s$ such that for all $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma(k^s/k)$ , we have $f^{-1} \\cdot\\, ^\\gamma\\! f \\in \\text{Int}(G)$ , and such that the induced isomorphism $X(f)$ of based root data, when restricted to $\\Delta$ , coincides with $\\rho$ ? I basically need the Galois action to be preserved by $f$ . At first I thought I could just take any inner twist $f$ and compose it with an automorphism of $G'$ , but I don't think that works. gr.group-theory algebraic-groups Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 13, 2020 at 17:47 Mikhail Borovoi 15.4k 2 2 gold badges 39 39 silver badges 88 88 bronze badges asked Aug 13, 2020 at 1:50 Not a grad student 913 4 4 silver badges 15 15 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ In general No, because the induced isomorphism of the based root data must induce an isomorphism of the Dynkin diagrams. $\\endgroup$ Mikhail Borovoi –  Mikhail Borovoi 2020-08-13 17:53:21 +00:00 Commented Aug 13, 2020 at 17:53 $\\begingroup$ What if the group is adjoint? $\\endgroup$ Mehta –  Mehta 2020-08-13 23:00:55 +00:00 Commented Aug 13, 2020 at 23:00 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
