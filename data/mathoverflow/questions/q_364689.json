  "body": "I am trying to understand/count the number of solutions of a number of equations in finite groups and came across the following class function: $$ \\theta_\\chi(x) = \\sum_{y\\in G} |C_G(xy)y \\cap C_G(x)| \\chi([y,x]) $$ where $\\chi$ is an irreducible character of $G$ . Calculating its values seems to be a delicate task as one has to understand very well the centralizers of $G$ , their cosets and their intersections. **Two questions: Has any one seen/studied this formula or a similar one? Any idea/suggestion about how to simplify this expression?** The function $\\theta_\\chi$ can be used to calculate the coefficients of the class function $$f_3(g) = |\\{(x,y,z)\\in G^3 : [x,y]=[x,z]=[y,z]=g \\}|$$ as a linear combination of the irreducible character of $G$ . More precisely, if we let $$ m_\\chi = \\sum_{x\\in G} \\theta_\\chi(x) $$ then $$f_3(g) = \\sum_{\\chi \\in Irr(G)} \\frac{m_\\chi}{|G|}\\chi(g) $$ . gr.group-theory finite-groups characters Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 2, 2020 at 20:41 asked Jul 2, 2020 at 19:40 Enrique Torres 41 2 2 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 $\\begingroup$ Is $C_G$ the centraliser or the conjugacy class? $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-07-02 20:19:19 +00:00 Commented Jul 2, 2020 at 20:19 $\\begingroup$ Also, could you say anything further about how this arose?
