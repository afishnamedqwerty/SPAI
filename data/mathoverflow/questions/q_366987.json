  "body": "Let $X$ and $Y$ be two discrete random variables distributed according to $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ , respectively. Consider the following optimization problems $$\\inf_{\\pi\\in \\Pi(\\mu, \\nu)}\\Pr(X\\neq Y),$$ where $\\Pi(\\mu, \\nu)$ denotes the set of all couplings of $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ , i.e., all joint distributions $P_{XY}$ whose marginals are given by $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ . It is very well-known that the above minimization is given by total variation distance: $$\\inf_{\\pi\\in \\Pi(\\mu, \\nu)}\\Pr(X\\neq Y) = d_{TV}(\\mu, \\nu).$$ My question is s follows. Now consider $X\\sim \\mu$ and $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are two independent samples of $\\nu$ . Now, what is $$\\inf_{\\pi\\in \\Pi(\\mu, \\nu)}\\Pr(X\\neq Y_1, X\\neq Y_2)?$$ Has it appeared before? Any connections with known probability distance measures? pr.probability st.statistics probability-distributions oc.optimization-and-control it.information-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 31, 2020 at 0:08 math-Student 1,139 7 7 silver badges 12 12 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 7 1 $\\begingroup$ Did you mean $\\pi(X \\ne Y)$ rather than $\\operatorname{Pr}(X \\ne Y)$? Also, what is the joint distribution of $(X,Y_1,Y_2)$ once $\\pi$ is chosen? (If $\\mu=\\nu$ and $\\pi$ is the diagonal coupling, and both $(X,Y_1)$ and $(X,Y_2)$ are assumed to be distributed according to $\\pi$, then we have $X=Y_1$ a.s. and $X=Y_2$ a.s., so it is problematic to require that $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are independent.) $\\endgroup$ Mateusz Kwaśnicki –  Mateusz Kwaśnicki 2020-07-31 01:06:04 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 1:06 $\\begingroup$ Yes, I mean $\\pi(X\\neq Y)$. The joint distribution is given by $\\pi(x, y_1, y_2) = \\nu(y_1)\\nu(y_2)P_{X|Y_1Y_2}(x|y_1,y_2)$ for some conditional distribution $P_{X|Y_1Y_2}$. Then the first marginal should be $\\mu$, the second and third should be $\\nu$. $\\endgroup$ math-Student –  math-Student 2020-07-31 01:43:10 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 1:43 $\\begingroup$ If $\\mu = \\nu$, then the above infiumum should be zero. $\\endgroup$ math-Student –  math-Student 2020-07-31 01:43:56 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 1:43 1 $\\begingroup$ But look: the infimum is over couplings $\\pi$ of $\\mu$ and $\\nu$, while under the infimum a triple coupling $\\bar\\pi$ of $\\mu$, $\\nu$ and $\\nu$ is used. My point is that for a general $\\pi$ it is not possible to construct any $\\bar\\pi$ such that $\\pi(A \\times B) = \\bar\\pi(A \\times B \\times \\mathcal Y) = \\bar\\pi(A \\times \\mathcal Y \\times B)$ and $\\bar\\pi(\\mathcal X \\times B_1 \\times B_2) = \\nu(B_1)\\nu(B_2)$. (Here of course $\\mathcal X$ is the set of all possible outcomes of $X$, and $\\mathcal Y$ the set of all outcomes of $Y$.) $\\endgroup$ Mateusz Kwaśnicki –  Mateusz Kwaśnicki 2020-07-31 08:49:40 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 8:49 1 $\\begingroup$ Note that this quantity can vanish even if $\\mu \\neq \\nu$, for example when $\\mu$ is the law of $\\min\\{Y_1,Y_2\\}$, so it wouldn't be a good notion of 'distance'... $\\endgroup$ Martin Hairer –  Martin Hairer 2020-07-31 16:55:49 +00:00 Commented Jul 31, 2020 at 16:55  |  Show 2 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
