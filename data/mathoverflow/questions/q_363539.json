  "body": "Ideally I would like to find exact value of $Mr'$ where $r'=\\frac{1}{M'}$ where $M'$ ranges from $1$ to $T+1$ and $1\\leq M\\leq T$ holds. However in real world approximations have finite precision. If I use truncation of $r'$ I get an estimate of $y\\leq Mr'$ . I just want to get a reasonable approximation of $r'$ such that if $y\\leq1$ or $>1$ then $M\\leq M'$ or $M'<M$ holds respectively. The period of rationals can be as large as denominator. So in this case the number of digits should be at least $T$ in worst case since $M$ is upper bound by $T$ . Is the lower bound $T$ on number of digits sufficient up to constant multiplicative factors or perhaps we may need $poly(T)$ number of digits or perhaps we need superpolynomial in $T$ ? What is the upper bound? Thus my question is following: How many digits in base $b$ should $r'$ be truncated to as a function of $T$ to ensure that $M<M'\\leq T+1$ holds iff $0<y<1$ holds (that is it works even at $M'=M+1$ at every $M\\in\\{1,2,3\\dots,T-1,T\\}$ )? nt.number-theory na.numerical-analysis diophantine-approximation Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 20, 2020 at 11:55 asked Jun 19, 2020 at 15:02 VS. 1,846 1 1 gold badge 12 12 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ Well, of these, $1/(T + 1)$ is the closest to $0$ and $T/(T + 1)$ is the closest to $1$, so just however many digits you need to distinguish $1/(T + 1)$ from $0$ and $T/(T + 1)$ from $1$, right? $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-06-24 08:49:50 +00:00 Commented Jun 24, 2020 at 8:49 $\\begingroup$ Yes the resolution is $\\frac1{T+1}$ which gives an estimate of possibly at most $\\frac{c\\log T}{\\log b}$ for the number of $b$ digits where $c$ is some constant with $c>0$. $\\endgroup$ VS. –  VS. 2020-06-24 12:16:30 +00:00 Commented Jun 24, 2020 at 12:16 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
