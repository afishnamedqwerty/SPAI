  "title": "dg.differential geometry - Is Laplacian a surjective operator?",
  "body": "For a closed manifold the laplacian is almost surjective operator since the index of $\\Delta$ is zero and there is no a non constant harmonic function. So the codimension of the image of $\\Delta$ is equal to $1$. Now assume that $M$ is an open manifold(non compact without boundary). What type of results exist for the image of $\\Delta$. Is it surjective? Is the codimension of its image finite? dg.differential-geometry ap.analysis-of-pdes differential-operators laplacian Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Mar 9, 2019 at 20:36 YCor 67.5k 5 5 gold badges 203 203 silver badges 301 301 bronze badges asked Oct 6, 2014 at 14:43 Ali Taghavi 1 $\\endgroup$ 3 3 $\\begingroup$ If $M\\cup\\partial M$ is compact, the Dirichlet problem is solvable and therefore $\\Delta$ is surjective on reasonnable functional spaces. $\\endgroup$ Denis Serre –  Denis Serre 2014-10-06 15:04:36 +00:00 Commented Oct 6, 2014 at 15:04 11 $\\begingroup$ You should be more precise about the function spaces. For example, $\\Delta:C^\\infty(\\mathbb R^2) \\to C^\\infty(\\mathbb R^2)$ is surjective but $\\Delta:C^2(\\mathbb R^2) \\to C^0(\\mathbb R^2)$ is not. $\\endgroup$ Jochen Wengenroth –  Jochen Wengenroth 2014-10-06 15:50:04 +00:00 Commented Oct 6, 2014 at 15:50 4 $\\begingroup$ $\\Delta$ on $L^2(\\mathbb R^n)$ is not surjective either because $0$ is in the spectrum. $\\endgroup$ Christian Remling –  Christian Remling 2014-10-06 17:38:55 +00:00 Commented Oct 6, 2014 at 17:38 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
