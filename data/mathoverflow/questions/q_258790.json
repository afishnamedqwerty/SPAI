  "title": "nt.number theory - Zero mean constraint for correlations with the Mobius function",
  "body": "An aspect of my research has lead me to believe that I need to distinguish between those bounded functions $\\xi:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}$ which correlate with the Mobius function $\\mu(n)$ , i.e. have the property that $$\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\mu(n)\\xi(n)\\neq o(x),$$ according as to whether $$\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\xi(n)= o(x)$$ or not. I believe this is necessary in order to avoid certain cases: for example, if one fixes a square free natural number $k>1$ and takes $\\xi(n)=1$ for $n\\neq mk$ and $\\xi(mk)=\\mu(m)$ , $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ , we have $$\\frac{1}{x}\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\mu(n)\\xi(n)\\sim \\frac{6\\mu(k)}{\\pi^2\\phi(k)}$$ and $$\\frac{1}{x}\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\xi(n)\\sim 1-\\frac{1}{k}.$$ Of course such cases are in some sense artificial, none-the-less it seems incomplete to consider the notion of Mobius correlation without a zero mean constraint---at least because $\\mu(n)$ itself has zero mean. For this reason I would like to ask about the following: How are these cases distinguished when considering sums of the form $$\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\mu(n)\\xi(n)$$ in the context of topological dynamics, or; as the inverse Mellin transform of a Dirichlet series with coefficients $\\mu(n)\\xi(n)$ ? To put it another way, I would like to know where the mean-value of $\\xi$ comes into play when considering sums of this form, and if there a qualitative relation/some expression you use in which the mean value of $\\xi$ appears explicitly? nt.number-theory analytic-number-theory mobius-inversion Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Jan 4, 2017 at 22:00 Kevin Smith 2,490 15 15 silver badges 30 30 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 $\\begingroup$ Since $\\sum_{n < x} \\mu(n) = \\sum_\\rho \\frac{x^\\rho}{\\zeta'(\\rho) \\rho} + O(1)$ , what comes into play is $\\sum_{n < x}(\\xi(n)-\\xi(n-1)) n^{\\rho}$ and hence $\\sum_{n < x} \\xi(n) n^{\\rho-1}$ where $\\rho$ are the non-trivial zeros of $\\zeta(s)$. Now you probably have some particular sequences $\\xi(n)$ in mind (the Dirichlet characters ?) $\\endgroup$ reuns –  reuns 2017-01-06 11:51:44 +00:00 Commented Jan 6, 2017 at 11:51 $\\begingroup$ @user1952009 My interest is in general bounded complex valued sequences. I believe the formula you have stated requires RH.
