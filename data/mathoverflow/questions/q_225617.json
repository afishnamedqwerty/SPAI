  "title": "reference request - Well-posedness of gradient flows",
  "body": "For a convex lower-semicontinuous functional on a Hilbert space $I\\colon H\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$, it is shown in Evans' PDE that the Hilbert-space-valued ODE $$\\begin{cases}\\mathbf{u}'(t)\\in-\\partial I[\\mathbf{u}(t)]\\\\\\mathbf{u}(0)=u\\in H\\end{cases}$$ is well-posed for all time, where $\\partial I[\\cdot]$ denotes the subdifferential. The intuition makes perfect sense, and I am wondering if there are similar results by relaxing convexity. In particular, is there a well-posedness result if $I$ is say simply bounded from below, or coercive? Intuitively it seems plausible, but I haven't been able to find a nice resource on this matter. Perhaps even a nice text on variational methods might have what I'm looking for? reference-request ap.analysis-of-pdes convex-optimization calculus-of-variations gradient-flows Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited May 18, 2020 at 21:03 leo monsaingeon 5,285 2 2 gold badges 26 26 silver badges 51 51 bronze badges asked Dec 8, 2015 at 21:11 charlestoncrabb 123 6 6 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 1 $\\begingroup$ MathSciNet tells me about some papers of Rossi and Savare MR2224826, and MR2148878. Taking a quick look, it seems that one of the things that breaks is uniqueness. Not sure if this is \"old\" enough to have made it into textbooks yet. $\\endgroup$ Willie Wong –  Willie Wong 2015-12-08 22:22:21 +00:00 Commented Dec 8, 2015 at 22:22 $\\begingroup$ Thank you @WillieWong, the second article is very helpful and interesting! $\\endgroup$ charlestoncrabb –  charlestoncrabb 2015-12-10 20:22:46 +00:00 Commented Dec 10, 2015 at 20:22 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
