  "title": "fa.functional analysis - Empty Weyl/Fredholm spectrum of an operator on an infinite dimensional Banach space",
  "body": "Let $X$ be a complex infinite dimensional Banach space, and let $T \\in B(X)$ be nonscalar. The Fredholm spectrum of $T$ is defined by: $$ \\sigma_{\\Phi} (T) := \\lbrace \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C} : T- \\lambda Id \\not \\in \\Phi \\rbrace $$ (an operator is Fredholm iff $\\dim \\ker T, \\dim \\ker T^* < \\infty$ , where $T^*$ denotes the adjoint of $T$ ; $\\Phi$ is the set of Fredholm operators in $B(X)$ ). Moreover, the Weyl spectrum of $T$ is defined by: $$ \\sigma_{w}(T):= \\lbrace \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C} : T- \\lambda Id \\not \\in \\Phi_0 \\rbrace $$ where $\\Phi_0$ is the set of Fredholm operators with index $0$ , i.e. $\\dim \\ker T = \\dim \\ker T^* < \\infty$ . It can be seen that: $$ \\sigma_{\\Phi}(T) \\subseteq \\sigma_{w}(T) \\subseteq \\sigma(T) $$ While it is known that $\\sigma(T)$ is always nonempty, is it possible that $\\sigma_{\\Phi}(T) = \\emptyset$ ? According to formula (8.50) in V. Rakočević, E. Malkowsky. Advanced Functional Analysis, 2019 , we have (at least when $X$ is Hilbert): $$ \\sigma(T)=\\sigma_{w}(T) \\cup \\sigma_p(T) $$ (where $\\sigma_p(T)$ denotes the point spectrum, i.e. the eigenvalues of $T$ ), so if $T$ does not have any eigenvalue the Weyl spectrum is certainly nonempty. More generally, what about $\\sigma_{\\Phi}$ ? Is it always nonempty or can it be empty in some cases? fa.functional-analysis banach-spaces operator-theory fredholm-operators Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 11, 2020 at 12:55 asked Jul 11, 2020 at 12:42 Manuel Norman 1,195 2 2 gold badges 8 8 silver badges 13 13 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 4 $\\begingroup$ The Fredholm spectrum of $T$ coincides with the spectrum of the equivalence class of $T$ in the Calkin algebra of $X$, so it is indeed non-empty. $\\endgroup$ Jochen Glueck –  Jochen Glueck 2020-07-11 13:29:14 +00:00 Commented Jul 11, 2020 at 13:29 $\\begingroup$ Thank you very much! $\\endgroup$ Manuel Norman –  Manuel Norman 2020-07-11 13:32:13 +00:00 Commented Jul 11, 2020 at 13:32 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
