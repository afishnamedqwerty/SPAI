  "title": "gr.group theory - Term and theories about &quot;relation-free&quot; elements in a group?",
  "body": "For a group $G$ , there are two elements a, b which are \"relation-free\", i.e., there is no nonempty, reduced word $W(X,Y)$ such that $W(a,b)=1$ in $G$ . Is there any terminologies or theories for that? (My group is a free product of finite cyclic groups, and I'm considering one element is not contained in a factor, but is a product of generators of each factors.) gr.group-theory geometric-group-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Aug 11, 2020 at 4:34 qkqh 347 1 1 silver badge 9 9 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 13 9 $\\begingroup$ In other words, $\\langle a,b \\rangle$ is a free subgroup with $\\{a,b\\}$ as a basis, no? $\\endgroup$ AGenevois –  AGenevois 2020-08-11 05:33:58 +00:00 Commented Aug 11, 2020 at 5:33 1 $\\begingroup$ In addition to the comment of @AGenevois, as your setting is in the subgroups of a free product of finite cyclic groups you may be interested in the Kurosh subgroup theorem . $\\endgroup$ Carl-Fredrik Nyberg Brodda –  Carl-Fredrik Nyberg Brodda 2020-08-11 08:03:12 +00:00 Commented Aug 11, 2020 at 8:03 $\\begingroup$ I'm calling this a \"free pair\", and more generally $(x_1,\\dots,x_n)$ a free $n$-tuple if the corresponding map $F_n\\to G$ is injective. $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-08-12 05:36:58 +00:00 Commented Aug 12, 2020 at 5:36 $\\begingroup$ @AGenevois;@Carl-Fredrik Nyberg Brodda Yes, it is. Maybe, I should ask more, I want to know some about a normally generated subgroup with the two elements. For instance, $\\langle X^n, Y\\rangle \\subsetneq \\langle X,Y\\rangle$ for any $n>1$, but I don't know whether $\\langle\\langle X^n, Y\\rangle\\rangle_G \\subsetneq \\langle\\langle X,Y \\rangle\\rangle_G$. $\\endgroup$ qkqh –  qkqh 2020-08-12 06:00:48 +00:00 Commented Aug 12, 2020 at 6:00 1 $\\begingroup$ What you are asking in the comments is essentially unrelated to the question. You could ask a new one. I will say there is probably subtlty in what you are asking. For example, it is non trivial to show that $G$ isn't normally generated by a single element. $\\endgroup$ user35370 –  user35370 2020-08-13 18:45:54 +00:00 Commented Aug 13, 2020 at 18:45  |  Show 8 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
