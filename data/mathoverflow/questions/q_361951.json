  "title": "ag.algebraic geometry - Surjectivity of multiplicative map (in more specific case)",
  "body": "(I have asked the question Surjectivity of multiplicative map . I ask here the more specific case.) Let $S$ be a smooth complex algebraic surface, and $D$ be a divisor on $S$ such that $D^2>0$ and $H^i(S, \\mathcal{O}(nD)) = 0 $ for all $i > 0, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 1}$ ( $D$ is not necessarily ample , but nef & big). Write $W = S \\times S$ and the coherent sheaf $\\mathcal{G} = \\mathcal{O}_{S}(nD) \\boxtimes \\mathcal{O}_{S}(nD)$ on $W$ . Suppose that we have an exact sequence $$ 0 \\rightarrow H^0(W, \\mathcal{G} \\otimes I_{\\Delta}^{n}) \\rightarrow H^0(W, \\mathcal{G}) \\xrightarrow{\\varphi} H^0(W, \\mathcal{G} \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_W/I_{\\Delta}^{n}) \\rightarrow H^1(W, \\mathcal{G} \\otimes I_{\\Delta}^{n}) \\rightarrow 0.$$ where $\\Delta$ is a diagonal embedding $S \\hookrightarrow S \\times S = W$ and $I_{\\Delta}$ is an idela sheaf of $\\Delta$ . By the Kunneth formula, we have $H^0(W, \\mathcal{G}) = H^0(S, \\mathcal{O}_S(nD)) \\otimes H^0(S, \\mathcal{O}_S(nD)).$ So, $\\varphi$ can be regarded as a multiplicative map followed by some inflation into infinitesimal neighborhood. I want to show the surjectivity of the map $\\varphi$ , or equivalently, the vanishing of $H^1(W, \\mathcal{G} \\otimes I_{\\Delta}^{n})$ (under the action of $\\mathfrak{S}_2$ in practice) for sufficiently large $n$ . The sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_W/I_{\\Delta}^{n}$ has a filtration by $I^k_{\\Delta}/I^{n}_{\\Delta}$ with associated graded factors $$ I^k_{\\Delta}/I^{k+1}_{\\Delta} \\simeq Sym^k(\\Omega_S), \\ 0 \\leq k \\leq n-1. $$ So, I think we have to check the surjectivity on each $H^0(S, \\mathcal{O}(2nD)\\otimes Sym^{k}(\\Omega_S))$ (is it right?). I have shown $H^i(S, \\mathcal{O}_S(2nD) \\otimes Sym^k(\\Omega_S)) = 0$ for all $i > 0$ and $0 \\leq k \\leq n-1$ . I found the paper of Mark L. Green Koszul cohomology and the geometry of projective varieties (I read part of it) which says that: Corollary(4.e.4)(The Explicit $H^0$ Lemma). Let $C$ be a smooth curve of genus $g$ , and $L \\rightarrow C$ and $M \\rightarrow C$ analytic line bundles. Assume that $\\deg L \\leq \\deg M$ and that $|L|$ is base-point free. If either $$\\deg L + \\deg M \\geq 4g + 2$$ or $$\\deg M = 2g+1, \\deg L = 2g$$ then the multiplication map $$H^0(C, L) \\otimes H^0(C, M) \\rightarrow H^0(C, L \\otimes M)$$ is surjectictive. My question is that can we generalize this statement to the case of surfaces? How can I prove the surjectivity of $\\varphi$ ? I appreciate any advice, answers, or references. ag.algebraic-geometry sheaf-cohomology Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 25, 2020 at 3:39 asked Jun 2, 2020 at 6:59 Y.
