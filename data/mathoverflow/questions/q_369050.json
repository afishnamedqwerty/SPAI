  "body": "I am working in derived category $D^b(X)$ of coherent sheaves on a smooth projective varitey. Let $E,F$ be two sheaves on $X$ , with $\\mathrm{R}Hom(E,F)=k\\oplus k[-1]$ , I consider the following triangle: $$\\mathrm{RHom}(E,F)\\otimes E\\rightarrow F\\rightarrow G$$ . We know that in Grothendieck group, $[F]=[G]$ since $[\\mathrm{RHom}(E,F)\\otimes E]=0$ . Now I consider relative situtaion. Let $X\\times\\mathbb{P}^1\\xrightarrow{\\pi}\\mathbb{P}^1$ and $X\\times\\mathbb{P}^1\\xrightarrow{q} X$ to be two projection maps. Consider the relative version of the triangle above: $$\\pi^*R\\pi_*\\mathrm{R}\\mathcal{H}om(q^*E,\\mathcal{F})\\otimes q^*E\\rightarrow\\mathcal{F}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}$$ where $\\mathcal{F}$ is a coherent sheaf on $X\\times\\mathbb{P}^1$ , $i_s^*\\mathcal{F}=F$ for each $s\\in\\mathbb{P}^1$ . I expect in $K_0(X\\times\\mathbb{P}^1)$ , $[\\pi^*R\\pi_*\\mathrm{R}\\mathcal{H}om(q^*E,\\mathcal{F})\\otimes q^*E]$ is also 0. Is this true? How do I show this if it is true? ag.algebraic-geometry sheaf-theory derived-categories grothendieck-rings Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Aug 13, 2020 at 11:42 user41650 2,012 13 13 silver badges 23 23 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
