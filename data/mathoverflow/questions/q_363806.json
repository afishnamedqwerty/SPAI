  "body": "Given an object $A$ in a category $\\mathcal{C}$ , the functor $Hom_{\\mathcal{C}}(A,-)$ is tautologically continuous i.e. limit-preserving. Let $F$ be a subfunctor of $Hom_{\\mathcal{C}}(A,-)$ , is $F$ in general continuous? We might assume $F$ is fully-faithful if necessary. ct.category-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jun 22, 2020 at 10:13 gregodom 319 1 1 silver badge 3 3 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 6 $\\begingroup$ Take $\\mathcal C$ a meet-semilattice.

What would be your example of a fully faithful subfunctor of a representable functor? $\\endgroup$ მამუკა ჯიბლაძე –  მამუკა ჯიბლაძე 2020-06-23 05:45:01 +00:00 Commented Jun 23, 2020 at 5:45 $\\begingroup$ @მამუკაჯიბლაძე I do have an example for the fully faithful $F$ but it seems not easy to describe in a few lines... Do you have a proof / reference that such $F$ is necessarily continuous? Thanks! $\\endgroup$ gregodom –  gregodom 2020-06-24 15:48:29 +00:00 Commented Jun 24, 2020 at 15:48 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
