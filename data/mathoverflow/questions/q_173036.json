  "body": "Can you provide a proof or a counterexample for the following claim : Let $P_m(x)=2^{-m}\\cdot((x-\\sqrt{x^2-4})^m+(x+\\sqrt{x^2-4})^m)$ . Let $F_{p,n}= (2p)^{2^n}+1 $ where $p$ is a prime number greater than $5$ , and $n\\ge2$ . Let $S_i=P_{2p}(S_{i-1})$ with $S_0=P_{p^2}(8)$ , then $$F_{p,n} \\text{ is prime iff } S_{2^n-2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{F_{p,n}}$$ . You can run this test here . A list of generalized Fermat primes sorted by base can be found here . I have verified this claim for $p \\in [7,5000]$ with $n \\in [2,10]$ and there were no counterexamples . nt.number-theory prime-numbers counterexamples elementary-proofs Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 13, 2020 at 3:50 asked Jul 1, 2014 at 9:57 Pedja 2,899 16 16 silver badges 28 28 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 $\\begingroup$ Looks like a generalization of arxiv.org/abs/0705.3664 (which concerns $b=2$) $\\endgroup$ Max Alekseyev –  Max Alekseyev 2018-04-22 13:09:20 +00:00 Commented Apr 22, 2018 at 13:09 $\\begingroup$ @MaxAlekseyev Actually this is a generalization of Inkeri's primality test for Fermat numbers...Reference : Tests for primality, Ann.

The claim can be rephrased as $F_{p,n}$ is prime iff $T_{2^{2^n-2}p^{2^n}}(4)=0$ mod $F_{p,n}$. Since $T_m(T_n(x))=T_{mn}(x)$, the RHS can be computed efficiently as $T_{ (2p)}^{2^n-2}(T_{p^2}(4))$ mod $F_{p,n}$, where the $2^n-2$ in the power means iteration. $\\endgroup$ Chua KS –  Chua KS 2020-08-15 04:48:33 +00:00 Commented Aug 15, 2020 at 4:48 1 $\\begingroup$ It seems useful to state many of your tests in term of Chebyshev.Eg. Lucas-Lehmer for Mersenne prime $M_p=2^p-1$ can be rephrased as $M_p$ is prime iff $T_{2^{p-2}}(2)=0$ mod $M_p$ and the Chebyshev rule $T_m(T_n(x))=T_{mn}(x)$ implied many possible method for computing the residue. Since $2^{p-2}=4^{(p-3)/2}.2$, one can iterate with $T_4$ as $T_{2^{p-2}}(2)=T_4^{(p-3)/2}(T_2(2))$ mod $M_p$. This halfed the number of steps but evaluating $T_4$ is more expansive. Every partition of $p-2$ into positive parts give a different way to compute the residue. At least good for checking correctness $\\endgroup$ Chua KS –  Chua KS 2020-08-18 02:18:26 +00:00 Commented Aug 18, 2020 at 2:18 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
