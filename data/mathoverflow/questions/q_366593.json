As you mentioned, this formula just gives 0 for negative even integers. The value you are interested in is equivalent to computing $\\zeta(3), \\zeta(5), \\cdots$, but these are much more mysterious, with no closed formulae. In fact, despite there being a closed formula for even natural numbers, just proving that $\\zeta(3)$ is irrational ended up a very subtle argument by Apery, and there are few irrationality results for the others. $\\endgroup$ Ralph Furman –  Ralph Furman 2020-07-27 19:01:32 +00:00 Commented Jul 27, 2020 at 19:01 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
