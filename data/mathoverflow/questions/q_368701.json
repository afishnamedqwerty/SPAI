  "body": "From Hurwitz's theorem about irreducible factor $F_{n-1}(x)$ of degree $\\varphi(n-1)$ of $x^{n-1}-1$ we can deduce the following criterion for the primality of $N=2^m \\cdot p_1^{n_1} \\cdot p_2^{n_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k^{n_k} +1$ : Let $N=2^m \\cdot p_1^{n_1} \\cdot p_2^{n_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k^{n_k} +1$ , $m>0 , n_1>0 ,n_2>0, \\ldots ,n_k>0$ with $k$ fixed odd primes $\\{p_1,p_2, \\ldots ,p_k \\}$ , $p_i<p_j$ for $i<j$ . Let $q$ be a product of $p_1,p_2, \\ldots ,p_k $ and let $\\Phi_n(x)$ be the nth cyclotomic polynomial . If there exists an integer $a$ such that $$\\Phi_q\\left(-a^{(N-1)/2q}\\right)\\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$$ then $N$ is a prime. You can run this test here . My question is: What is the most efficient algorithm for calculating $\\Phi_q(b) \\operatorname{mod} N$ , where $b$ is an integer? I know that $\\Phi_q(b)$ can be calculated by using repeated polynomial division (see Algorithm 1 in this paper). I also know that there is an algorithm (see Algorithm 2 in the paper mentioned above) for calculating $\\Phi_{mp}(x) \\operatorname{mod} M$ , where $m$ is an odd squarefree integer , $p$ is a prime not dividing $m$ and $M$ is a prime , but I am not sure if these two algorithms can be used for efficiently calculation of $\\Phi_q(b) \\operatorname{mod} N$ . nt.number-theory prime-numbers algorithms Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Aug 9, 2020 at 13:09 Pedja 2,899 16 16 silver badges 28 28 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
