  "body": "Yesterday I was thinking in speculative relationships between certain figurate numbers, please see if you need the tables, and references from the article of the encyclopedia MathWorld Figurate Number. . I wondered about speculative relationships of the type: First I take a prism of basis the hex number and $z$ as height, we represent the hex number of this basis with the integer $x$ . Secondly we do the same thing, we multiply $z$ by a centered pentagonal number using $y$ in its representation to build a second prism. Finally we try the comparison $$z\\cdot\\left(\\text{hex number}\\right)+z\\cdot\\left(\\text{centered pentagonal number}\\right)=\\text{Haüy octahedral number}$$ where the variable for the representation of our Haüy octahedral number in RHS is precisely the height $z$ . Such equation for positive integers $x,y,z\\geq 1$ is equivalent to $$18x^2z+18xz+15y^2z+15yz-8z^3+12z^2-4z+6=0\\tag{1}.$$ Other equation that I've considered was $$z\\cdot\\left(\\text{hex number}\\right)-z\\cdot\\left(\\text{centered pentagonal number}\\right)=\\text{Haüy octahedral number}$$ that is equivalent to $$18 x^2 z + 18 x z - 15 y^2 z - 15 y z - 8 z^3 + 12 z^2 - 16 z + 6=0\\tag{2}.$$ Question. Can you find solutions of $(1)$ or $(2)$ ? Please, see below the computational facts. What can be a first professional step/statement that one can to deduce in the study of these equations $(1)$ or $(2)$ ? I am asking about how get a first professional proposition (what is a first interesting statement) for some of these equations, when one evokes the study of these equations. Many thanks. Fact. If we divide by $2$ the genuine equations, if I am not wrong, it is easy to prove that we only to need check the equations for odd integers $z\\geq 1$ and integers $y\\geq 1$ such the correspinding centered pentagonal number is an even integer, since the other cases are absurd. I can not deduce a similar statement for the congrence $\\equiv\\text{ mod }3$ (when we divide the equation by $3$ ). For each equation $(1)$ and $(2)$ Wolfram Alpha online calculator provide me partial derivaties and the polynomial discriminant, but I don't know it is useful to solve the problem in my Question. Computational facts. I can not to find solutions $(x,y,z)$ of the equation $(1)$ for integers $x,y,z\\geq 1$ when our integers run over the segments $1\\leq x\\leq 300$ and $1\\leq y\\leq 300$ and $1\\leq z\\leq 300$ . Similarly for the second equation and same segments of integers, our difference of figurate numbers $(2)$ , I can find only the solutions $(x,y,z)=(1,1,1)$ and $(x,y,z)=(31,34,1)$ nt.number-theory diophantine-equations Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 25, 2020 at 21:12 asked Aug 9, 2019 at 9:39 user142929 1 $\\endgroup$ 8 2 $\\begingroup$ Trivial observation for both equations: $z\\mid 6$. $\\endgroup$ Wojowu –  Wojowu 2019-08-09 11:24:51 +00:00 Commented Aug 9, 2019 at 11:24 1 $\\begingroup$ So we can replace each equation by a small number of equations in the two variables $x,y$. $\\endgroup$ Gerry Myerson –  Gerry Myerson 2019-08-09 11:45:23 +00:00 Commented Aug 9, 2019 at 11:45 1 $\\begingroup$ Since 142929, true to form, is unlikely to tell us what those octahedral numbers are, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centered_octahedral_number says they are $(2n+1)(2n^2+2n+3)/3$. $\\endgroup$ Gerry Myerson –  Gerry Myerson 2019-08-09 11:56:38 +00:00 Commented Aug 9, 2019 at 11:56 1 $\\begingroup$ When $z=1$, (1) becomes $18x^2+18x+15y^2+15y+6=0$ which, obviously, has no positive solutions. $\\endgroup$ Gerry Myerson –  Gerry Myerson 2019-08-09 12:05:39 +00:00 Commented Aug 9, 2019 at 12:05 1 $\\begingroup$ $$(2)\\overset{z\\to1}{\\implies}\\Bigl(5 (2 y + 1)\\Bigr)^2 - 30 \\Bigl(2 x + 1\\Bigr)^2 = -45$$ this Pell equation with infinite set positive solutions. $\\endgroup$ Dmitry Ezhov –  Dmitry Ezhov 2020-06-26 06:05:45 +00:00 Commented Jun 26, 2020 at 6:05  |  Show 3 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
