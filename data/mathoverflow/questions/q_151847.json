  "body": "Let $L$ be a locally free and finitely presented sheaf over a Noetherian scheme $X$ and $$ E\\overset{\\varphi}\\to F \\to L \\to 0$$ a free presentation of $L$ , where $E$ and $F$ have finite ranks $n$ and $m$ . Moreover, let $$ \\pi:G=G(n-k, E)\\to X $$ be the Grassmannian bundle of $(n-k)$ -hyperplanes of sections of $E$ . For any integer $k$ we can associate to $L$ two objects: The ideal sheaf $\\operatorname{Fitt}_k(L) \\subset \\mathcal{O}_X$ over $X$ , defined for example here . The ideal sheaf $\\operatorname{Grass}_k(L) \\subset \\mathcal{O}_G$ over $G$ , defined below. Def: Consider the natural short exact sequence of sheaves over $G$ $$ 0\\to S \\to \\pi^* E \\to Q \\to 0 $$ where $S$ and $Q$ are the universal subbundle and quotient bundle of $G$ . We define $\\operatorname{Grass}_k(L)$ to be the zero locus of the morphism of sheaves $$ S\\longrightarrow \\pi^*E \\overset{\\pi^*\\varphi} \\longrightarrow \\pi^* F $$ (i.e. the minimal ideal sheaf $I\\subset\\mathcal{O}_G$ such that $S/I\\to \\pi^* F/I$ is the zero morphism). Now it's time to ask my question. What is the relationship between $\\operatorname{Fitt}_k(L)$ and $ \\operatorname{Grass}_k(L)$ ? Notice that we can pull back $\\operatorname{Fitt}_k(L)$ using $G\\overset{\\pi}\\to X$ , and we get an ideal sheaf $\\pi^* \\operatorname{Fitt}_k(L) \\subset \\mathcal{O}_G $ . Maybe it's better to compare this one with $\\operatorname{Grass}_k(L)$ ? Of course the above sheaves are not isomorphic, as they even have different fibers. Indeed if we choose coordinates we see that, for $W\\in \\pi^{-1}(x)$ , the fiber $$ \\pi^* \\operatorname{Fitt}_k(L)_W = \\operatorname{Fitt}_k(L)_x $$ is generated by the $(n-k)\\times (n-k)$ minors of the matrix representation of $\\varphi$ , while the fibers $$ \\operatorname{Grass}_k(L)_W \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\operatorname{Grass}_k(L)_{W'} $$ are in general not the same for $W,W' \\in \\pi^{-1}(x)$ . If I understand correctly they are generated by the entries of the matrices corresponding to $\\varphi_{\\mid W}$ and $\\varphi_{\\mid W'}$ . Intuitively, the subscheme of $G$ corresponding to $\\operatorname{Grass}_k(L)$ is kind a blow-up of the subscheme of $X$ corresponding to $\\operatorname{Fitt}_k(L)$ : if $x \\in X$ is a point where the rank of $\\varphi_x$ is smaller than $t$ , it gets in some sense unwinded into couples $(x, W)$ where $W$ is a $t$ -plane in the kernel of $\\varphi_x$ . Could you help me making my intuition precise?
