  "title": "set theory - Partition $\\mathfrak c$-dense set to $\\mathfrak c$- many dense set",
  "body": "A subset of $A\\subset\\mathbb R$ is called $\\mathfrak c$ -dense if $ |A\\cap I|=\\mathfrak c$ for any none open interval $I\\subset\\mathbb R.$ Then, there is a partition for $A$ to continuum many dense set. Here is my idea: Let $\\{I_{\\xi}\\colon \\ \\xi<\\mathfrak c\\}$ be enumeration of all open interval subset $R$ and since $A$ is $\\mathfrak c$ -dense, so we have $A_{\\xi}= A\\cap I_{\\xi}$ and $|A_{\\xi}|=\\mathfrak c.$ Put $\\mathcal A=\\{A_\\xi\\colon \\ \\xi<\\mathfrak c\\}.$ Let $\\{\\langle r_\\xi, A_\\xi\\rangle\\colon \\ \\xi<\\mathfrak c\\}$ be an enumeration of $A\\times \\mathcal A$ with $\\mathfrak c$ -many repetitions, since $|A\\times \\mathcal A|=\\mathfrak c$ . By induction on $\\xi<\\mathfrak c$ , choose a sequence $$ x_\\xi\\in A_\\xi\\setminus \\{x_\\zeta\\colon \\ \\zeta<\\xi\\}$$ Now, for $r\\in A$ , let $D_r=\\{x_\\xi\\colon r_\\xi=r\\}$ . Notice that the points $x_\\xi$ are all distinct. so the sets $D_r$ 's are pairwise disjoint and it is to check they are dense. Now, if $$A\\setminus\\bigcup D_r=B.$$ So we can add the set $B$ to one of the sets $D_r$ and this finishes the proof. Please let me know if there is some thing wrong.
