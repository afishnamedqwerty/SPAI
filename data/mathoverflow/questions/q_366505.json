  "title": "nt.number theory - On the image of a polynomial map modulo two distinct primes",
  "body": "Let $Q_0, Q_1, Q_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x_0, x_1, x_2]$ be three non-singular ternary quadratic forms with integer coefficients. Let $T$ be a large real number, and let $p, q$ be two distinct primes having size $T^\\alpha/\\log T < p, q < T^\\alpha$ for some $\\alpha \\geq 1$ . Let $I(T) = [1, T^{1/2}) \\cap \\mathbb{Z}$ , and let $I_p(T), I_q(T)$ respectively denote the reduction of $I(T)$ mod $p,q$ . Consider the polynomial map $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x}) = (Q_0(\\mathbf{x}), Q_1(\\mathbf{x}), Q_2(\\mathbf{x}))$ . Define the set $\\displaystyle W_{\\mathcal{F},p,q}(T) = \\{\\mathbf{x} \\in [1,T]^3 \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^3 : \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x}) \\pmod{p} \\in I_p(T)^3, \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{x}) \\pmod{q} \\in I_q(T)^3 \\}.$ In other words, $W_{\\mathcal{F},p,q}(T)$ is the set of integer points in the box $[1,T]^3$ such that the triple $(Q_0(\\mathbf{x}), Q_1(\\mathbf{x}), Q_2(\\mathbf{x}))$ satisfies $Q_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\pmod{p} \\in I_p(T)$ and $Q_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\pmod{q} \\in I_q(T)$ for $i = 0,1,2$ . Is there a way to control the size of $W_{\\mathcal{F}, p, q,}(T)$ , especially for $\\alpha > 1$ ? The idea is that typically one would expect at least one of $Q_i(\\mathbf{x})$ to be \"large\" mod $p,q$ (i.e., does not land in $I_p(T), I_q(T)$ ) when $\\mathbf{x} \\in [1,T]^3$ , and for all three quadratic forms to be \"small\" for both moduli seems a very difficult condition to satisfy. Of course, this notion of \"large/small\" is virtually meaningless in the finite field setting. nt.number-theory quadratic-forms Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 24, 2020 at 23:50 Stanley Yao Xiao ♦ 31k 7 7 gold badges 63 63 silver badges 173 173 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
