Coefficients $f_i(\\alpha,t)$ are some known functions. operator-theory fractional-calculus Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 26, 2020 at 17:10 azonips 21 2 2 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 1 $\\begingroup$ There seems to be no such expansion, as this would imply that $(t - \\tau)^{\\alpha-1}$ can be written as $\\sum_k f_k(\\alpha, t) (t - \\tau)^{k-1}$, which is not the case. On the other hand, if $\\alpha > 1$, one can get arbitrarily good approximations (say, with respect to the supremum norm on $[0, t]$) by using finitely many terms: simply approximate $(t - \\tau)^{\\alpha-1}$ on $[0, t]$ by a polynomial. $\\endgroup$ Mateusz Kwaśnicki –  Mateusz Kwaśnicki 2020-07-26 19:22:23 +00:00 Commented Jul 26, 2020 at 19:22 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
