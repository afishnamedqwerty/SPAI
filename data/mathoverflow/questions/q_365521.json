  "body": "Let $a,b,c\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $c$ is inside the $n$ -disk with $a$ and $b$ as south and north poles. Then as $c$ moves toward $a$ through the line segment joining $a$ and $c$ , $c$ is also moving away from $b$ (in terms of $d(b,c)$ ). Is there an analogy of the above statement on Riemannian manifolds? Say replace 'distance' by 'Riemannian metric' and replace 'line segment' by 'geodesics'? Or, in other words, fix any $a$ and $b$ on a Riemannian manifold, what is the set of points $c$ such that when $c$ moves to $a$ through geodesics, $c$ is moving away from $b$ ? On $\\mathbb{R}^n$ we know the set contains all points $c$ such that $\\angle acb$ is not acute. riemannian-geometry smooth-manifolds Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 13, 2020 at 18:12 asked Jul 13, 2020 at 6:34 ryanriess 219 1 1 gold badge 2 2 silver badges 5 5 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 1 $\\begingroup$ Let your space be a line, $c=0,a=1,b=2$.

Put it in another way, fix any $a$ and $b$ on a Riemannian manifold, what is the set of points $c$ such that when $c$ moves to $a$ through geodesics, $c$ is moving away from $b$? $\\endgroup$ ryanriess –  ryanriess 2020-07-13 17:51:13 +00:00 Commented Jul 13, 2020 at 17:51 $\\begingroup$ You are talking about the Dirichlet domain / Voronoi diagram of a pair of points. It perhaps has other names, but that's one. $\\endgroup$ Ryan Budney –  Ryan Budney 2020-07-13 18:54:59 +00:00 Commented Jul 13, 2020 at 18:54 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
