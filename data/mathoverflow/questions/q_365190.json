  "body": "Let $p$ be a prime, and let $\\mathbb{F}_p$ be the finite field with $p$ elements. Let $a$ be a non-zero element of $\\mathbb{F}_p$ . Can we quickly evaluate $a^{2^r} \\mod{p}$ ? Using repeated squaring, this can be computed in time roughly $O(r\\log{p})$ . I would like to know if this can be done in time sublinear in $r$ . I suspect this is difficult in a general ring, but finite fields are quite nicely behaved from an algorithmic standpoint, so I am hopeful this is possible. gr.group-theory ac.commutative-algebra algorithms finite-fields computer-science Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 9, 2020 at 0:55 Gautam 1,901 12 12 silver badges 27 27 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 3 5 $\\begingroup$ is $r$ large with respect to $p$? If it's sufficiently large we can first calculate $2^r$ mod $p-1$ by repeated squaring using the binary expansion of $r$, then take the binary expansion of that, and do the same thing. $\\endgroup$ Will Sawin –  Will Sawin 2020-07-09 01:00:40 +00:00 Commented Jul 9, 2020 at 1:00 2 $\\begingroup$ In addition, if you know the factorization of $p-1$ (and hence the exponent $e$ of $\\mathbb{Z}/(p-1)$) then you can reduce $r$ mod $e$ before computing $2^r \\bmod{p-1}$. $\\endgroup$ Ben Smith –  Ben Smith 2020-07-09 07:24:30 +00:00 Commented Jul 9, 2020 at 7:24 $\\begingroup$ Obviously that should be $(\\mathbb{Z}/(p-1)\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ in my comment above. If you replace $p$ with an RSA modulus $N = pq$, then the supposed slowness of computing $a^{2^r} \\pmod{N}$ is the basis of the Rivest-Shamir-Wagner time lock . $\\endgroup$ Ben Smith –  Ben Smith 2020-07-10 06:13:00 +00:00 Commented Jul 10, 2020 at 6:13 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
