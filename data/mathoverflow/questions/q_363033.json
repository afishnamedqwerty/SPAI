  "title": "integration - Solving integral equation with an unknown probability distribution",
  "body": "Considering this system of integral equations, where $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{R} $ and $\\alpha\\in \\mathbb{C}$ are the unknown to solve : $$ 1=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(u) \\frac{ -1}{\\gamma-\\left(u-z^{*}+\\tau \\alpha^*\\right)\\left(u-z+\\tau \\alpha\\right)}\\mathrm{d}u$$ $$\\alpha^*=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}p(u) \\frac{ u-z+\\tau \\alpha}{\\gamma-\\left(u-z^{*}+\\tau \\alpha^*\\right)\\left(u-z+\\tau \\alpha\\right)}\\mathrm{d}u$$ $$\\alpha=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}p(u) \\frac{ u-z^*+\\tau \\alpha^*}{\\gamma-\\left(u-z^{*}+\\tau \\alpha^*\\right)\\left(u-z+\\tau \\alpha\\right)}\\mathrm{d}u$$ Where $\\alpha^*$ represents the complex conjugate of $\\alpha$ and $p(u)$ is a probability distribution. Is it possible to solve these equations without further information on $p(u)$ ? Or is it at least possible to change their representation to make them more friendly ? The solution $\\alpha$ would then give an equation representing the boundaries of the eigenvalues of a random matrix : $$ 1=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}p(u) \\frac{ 1}{\\left(u-z^{*}+\\tau \\alpha^*\\right)\\left(u-z+\\tau \\alpha\\right)}\\mathrm{d}u$$ Therefore I see $\\gamma$ and $\\alpha$ as intermediate steps, the boundaries only depend directly on $p(u)$ and not $\\alpha$ strictly speaking. Any remark, reference or advice is always very appreciated.

If $\\tau$ is real, then the third equation is the same as the second. $\\endgroup$ ofer zeitouni –  ofer zeitouni 2020-06-19 11:25:05 +00:00 Commented Jun 19, 2020 at 11:25 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
