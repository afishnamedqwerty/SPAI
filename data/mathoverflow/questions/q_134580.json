  "title": "linear algebra - Lattice basis reductions and finding minimal values",
  "body": "While reading several articles about lattice basis reduction I am left with a few questions. For one, I came across this piece of text Let $\\alpha$ and $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Also let $X>0$ and $X$ is large. Then to compute $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $\\text{max} (|x|,|y|) \\le X$ and such that $|\\alpha x + \\beta y|$ is minimal we apply the lattice basis reduction to the lattice generated by the columns ${1 \\choose C\\alpha}$ and ${0 \\choose C\\beta}$ for $C$ large enough. My question is where is the $C$ coming from? When is it large enough? It obviously depends on something... maybe on $X ?$ All hints, examples or explanations are very much welcome. linear-algebra mg.metric-geometry lattices cryptography vector-spaces Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited May 30, 2020 at 13:50 Martin Sleziak 4,813 4 4 gold badges 39 39 silver badges 42 42 bronze badges asked Jun 24, 2013 at 3:08 Zoe 1 $\\endgroup$ 3 1 $\\begingroup$ crossposted at math.stackexchange.com/questions/427934/… $\\endgroup$ Will Jagy –  Will Jagy 2013-06-24 04:57:00 +00:00 Commented Jun 24, 2013 at 4:57 $\\begingroup$ actually this is a different question... $\\endgroup$ Zoe –  Zoe 2013-06-24 05:18:46 +00:00 Commented Jun 24, 2013 at 5:18 $\\begingroup$ Looks very similar to the MSE one $\\endgroup$ Yemon Choi –  Yemon Choi 2013-06-24 09:43:10 +00:00 Commented Jun 24, 2013 at 9:43 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
