  "title": "gr.group theory - &quot;Natural&quot; embeddings of free groups in general linear groups",
  "body": "There are many embeddings of the free groups $\\mathbb{F}_n$ into $GL_m(\\mathbb{Z})$ . An often encountered example for $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is the Sanov subgroup generated by $$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\;\\text{ and } \\; \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}.$$ But an example that one could consider particularly \"natural\" is the commutator subgroup generated by $$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1\\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\;\\text{ and } \\; \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix},$$ since it follows from a group theoretic construction. Hence my question: what would be a natural choice of embedding for $\\mathbb{F}_n$ when $n>2$ ? gr.group-theory rt.representation-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 16, 2020 at 9:25 Tom Ultramelonman 733 5 5 silver badges 10 10 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 2 5 $\\begingroup$ If $\\langle x,y\\rangle$ is a \"natural\" embedding of $F_2$, then $\\langle x^iyx^{-i}: 0\\le i<n\\rangle$ is a \"natural\" embedding of $F_n$. $\\endgroup$ YCor –  YCor 2020-07-16 12:57:47 +00:00 Commented Jul 16, 2020 at 12:57 $\\begingroup$ I agree, this seems reasonably natural.
