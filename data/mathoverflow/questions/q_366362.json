  "body": "Let us consider two probability measures $\\mu \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^{p})$ and $\\nu \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^{q})$ with $p,q \\in \\mathbb{N}^{*}$ . We note $\\#$ the push forward operator i.e for $f: \\mathbb{R}^{p} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ measurable $f\\#\\mu \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^{q})$ defined by $f\\#\\mu(A)=\\mu(f^{-1}(A))=\\mu(\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p} | f(x) \\in A\\})$ for $A$ measurable set of $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$ . Let $l: \\mathbb{R}^{p} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ be a linear application and assume that $\\mu$ has a density $g$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}^{p}$ . My question is: If $q <p$ (we go from higher to lower dimension) does $l\\#\\mu$ has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$ ? I think this is true using the coarea formula. More precisely if $L\\in \\mathbb{R}^{q\\times p}$ the matrix associated to $l$ and $J_L=\\sqrt{det(LL^{T})}$ the density of $l\\#\\mu$ looks like: \\begin{equation} h(y)=\\int_{l^{-1}(y)} \\frac{g(x)}{J_L} dV_{l^{-1}(y)}(x) \\end{equation} where denotes $dV_{l^{-1}(y)}(x)$ the volume element. Is it correct ? What could go wrong if $q>p$ (we go from lower to higher dimension) ? pr.probability measure-theory probability-distributions Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 23, 2020 at 10:11 Titouan Vayer 607 3 3 silver badges 13 13 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 4 1 $\\begingroup$ Your argument is fine but implicitly requires that $l$ is surjective, otherwise $J_L = 0$. If $l$ is not surjective then it is clear that $l \\# \\mu$ does not have a density because it gives measure 1 to the image of $l$, which is a proper linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^q$ and therefore has Lebesgue measure zero. In particular this is the case for every $l$ when $q>p$. $\\endgroup$ Nate Eldredge –  Nate Eldredge 2020-07-23 12:24:37 +00:00 Commented Jul 23, 2020 at 12:24 1 $\\begingroup$ Building up on Nate Eldredge's comment: in the worst case scenario that your map $l$ is actually trivially zero, you see that $l\\|\\mu=\\delta_{0_{\\mathbb R^q}}$ is as far as possible from being absolutely continuous! For the positive answer, one way to put it is that if $\\mu\\ll dx_p$ then automatically $l\\#\\mu\\ll l\\#(dx_p)$. Now if $l$ is surjective it is an easy exercise to check that $l\\#(dx_p)\\ll dx_q$ (and this is actually an if and only if), hence in particular $l\\#\\mu\\ll l\\#(dx_p)\\ll dx_q$. $\\endgroup$ leo monsaingeon –  leo monsaingeon 2020-07-23 12:45:00 +00:00 Commented Jul 23, 2020 at 12:45 $\\begingroup$ $\\LaTeX$ comment... $$f\\#\\mu\\text{ or }f^\\sharp\\mu\\text{ ??}$$ $\\endgroup$ Gerald Edgar –  Gerald Edgar 2020-07-23 14:07:36 +00:00 Commented Jul 23, 2020 at 14:07 $\\begingroup$ Thank you very much ! $\\endgroup$ Titouan Vayer –  Titouan Vayer 2020-07-24 10:35:37 +00:00 Commented Jul 24, 2020 at 10:35 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
