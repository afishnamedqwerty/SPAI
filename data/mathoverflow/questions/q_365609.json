  "body": "We are given a set of $n$ distinct points $S=\\{\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}_n\\}$ in a Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$ , where the distance between two points $\\mathbf{x}_i,\\mathbf{x}_j\\in S$ is denoted by $d(i,j)$ for any $i,j\\in[n]$ , and $\\max_{i,j\\in [n]}d(i,j)=1$ . Let $\\mathcal{\\Pi}$ be the set of all functions $\\pi$ mapping each index of a point of $S$ to a distinct integer in $[n]$ , namely a permutation on the indices of the points of $S$ . We also define $$R(\\pi):=\\sum_{\\substack{(i,j,k)\\in[n]: \\\\\\pi(i)<\\pi(j)<\\pi(k)}} \\left(1-d(i,j)\\right)~,$$ $$\\pi^*:=\\arg\\max_{\\pi\\in\\mathcal{\\Pi}} R(\\pi)~.$$ Question: Can we prove the following conjecture? Does the answer depend on the number of dimensions of the Euclidean space? For any pair of elements $\\mathbf{x}_i,\\mathbf{x}_j\\in S$ such that $\\pi^*(i)<\\pi^*(j)$ , the average value of $R(\\pi)$ over all $\\pi\\in\\mathcal{\\Pi}$ such that $\\pi(i)<\\pi(j)$ , is greater than or equal to the average value of $R(\\pi')$ over all $\\pi'\\in\\mathcal{\\Pi}$ such that $\\pi'(i)>\\pi'(j)$ . co.combinatorics mg.metric-geometry discrete-geometry permutations combinatorial-optimization Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 27, 2020 at 17:55 asked Jul 14, 2020 at 13:19 Penelope Benenati 1,707 1 1 gold badge 10 10 silver badges 21 21 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 7 1 $\\begingroup$ It is an interesting question. I did not think carefully about it. Did you run some numerical calculations for instance? $\\endgroup$ Malkoun –  Malkoun 2020-07-16 19:41:27 +00:00 Commented Jul 16, 2020 at 19:41 $\\begingroup$ Thank you. Not specifically for this problem. I run some numerical experiments for this related question (which is even more important for my research now): mathoverflow.net/q/365472/115803 $\\endgroup$ Penelope Benenati –  Penelope Benenati 2020-07-16 20:29:18 +00:00 Commented Jul 16, 2020 at 20:29 $\\begingroup$ Bu the way, about the problem of this webpage, I hope that two average values of the question cannot be arbitrarily close to each other (when $n\\gg 1$, and even when $n\\to\\infty$). $\\endgroup$ Penelope Benenati –  Penelope Benenati 2020-07-16 20:31:38 +00:00 Commented Jul 16, 2020 at 20:31 $\\begingroup$ I guess in the sum for $R(\\pi)$ should be figured $k$. $\\endgroup$ Alex Ravsky –  Alex Ravsky 2020-07-17 04:47:29 +00:00 Commented Jul 17, 2020 at 4:47 1 $\\begingroup$ Also functions $\\pi$ mapping each point of $S$ to a distinct integer in $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ are bijective maps from $S$ to $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, whereas permutations of the elements of $S$ are bijective maps from $S$ to $S$. $\\endgroup$ Alex Ravsky –  Alex Ravsky 2020-07-17 05:08:09 +00:00 Commented Jul 17, 2020 at 5:08  |  Show 2 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
