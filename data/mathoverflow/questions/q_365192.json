  "body": "I've been studying $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$ -homotopy recently and would like some guidance with the question below. Thank you so much. Setup Fix $k$ a field of characteristic zero. Let $Sm_{k}$ denote the category of smooth $k$ -varieies. Let $\\tau$ be a Grothendieck topology on the category of simplicial presheaves of smooth $k$ -varieties. Consider this site with the $\\tau$ -local injective model structure and then Bausfield localize at the family $\\{\\mathbb{A}^{1}\\times U\\rightarrow U\\}$ for all $U \\in Sm_{k}$ . Given a presheaf of groups $\\mathrm{G}$ , we can define a simplicial presheaf $B\\mathrm{G}:Sm_{k}^{op}\\rightarrow sSet$ as follows: $B\\mathrm{G}(U)=B(\\mathrm{G}(U)) \\in sSet$ for all $U \\in Sm_{k}$ . Question Let $\\mathrm{G}$ and $\\mathrm{H}$ be presheaves of groups. Let $f_{1},f_{2}:\\mathrm{G}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}$ be considered as morphisms of simplicial presheaves. I would like to know if the following is true. If $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ are naively $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$ -homotopic, then so are $Bf_{1}$ and $Bf_{2}$ . ag.algebraic-geometry model-categories motivic-homotopy simplicial-presheaves Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 9, 2020 at 1:13 asked Jul 9, 2020 at 0:59 Faye3 317 1 1 silver badge 5 5 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 5 $\\begingroup$ Although not explicitly stated in the help centre (which seems to be a generic page for all SE websites), it is considered good practice to add at least one top level tag . $\\endgroup$ R. van Dobben de Bruyn –  R. van Dobben de Bruyn 2020-07-09 01:06:13 +00:00 Commented Jul 9, 2020 at 1:06 $\\begingroup$ Thank you for letting me know. $\\endgroup$ Faye3 –  Faye3 2020-07-09 01:14:05 +00:00 Commented Jul 9, 2020 at 1:14 $\\begingroup$ An $\\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy between $f_0$ and $f_1$ is a morphism $h:G\\to H^{\\mathbb{A}^1}$. Since the assignment $G\\mapsto BG$ is a functor and since we obviously have $B(H^{\\mathbb{A}^1})=(BH)^{\\mathbb{A}^1}$, the answer is yes (assuming that $h$ is morphism of groups, of course). $\\endgroup$ D.-C.

If $X$ is a sheaf of sets and $F$ a (pre)sheaf, then $F^X$ is the (pre)sheaf $U\\mapsto F(X\\times U)$. For $F$ a sheaf of groups, $F^X$ is a sheaf of groups and one checks rather directly that $B(F^X)=B(F)^X$. There is no structure on $X$. Take $X=\\mathbb{A}^1$. $\\endgroup$ D.-C. Cisinski –  D.-C.
