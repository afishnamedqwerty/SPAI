  "body": "Let $X$ be a smooth projective geometrically connected variety over $\\mathbb{Q}$ . Assume that for some $m>0$ we have $h^{i, 2m-i}(X)=0$ unless $i=m$ . Does there exist a number field $E$ such that for all but finitely many primes $l$ the homomorphism $\\mathrm{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to GL(H^{2m}(X_{\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}}, \\mathbb{Q}_l(m)))$ is the composition of the natural map $\\mathrm{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}/\\mathbb{Q})\\to \\mathrm{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$ and an injective map $\\mathrm{Gal}(E/\\mathbb{Q})\\to GL(H^{2m}(X_{\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}}, \\mathbb{Q}_l(m)))$ ? ag.algebraic-geometry arithmetic-geometry etale-cohomology galois-representations p-adic-hodge-theory Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Aug 5, 2020 at 15:52 asked Aug 5, 2020 at 10:19 user158636 $\\endgroup$ 8 $\\begingroup$ Are you willing to assume the Tate conjecture? $\\endgroup$ Daniel Litt –  Daniel Litt 2020-08-05 13:17:57 +00:00 Commented Aug 5, 2020 at 13:17 1 $\\begingroup$ Sure, then the image of the cycle class map gives a natural Q-structure (even Z-structure) after twisting by Q_l(m). $\\endgroup$ Daniel Litt –  Daniel Litt 2020-08-05 13:49:47 +00:00 Commented Aug 5, 2020 at 13:49 $\\begingroup$ You're supposed to take the Tate conjecture over some finite extensions $K$ of $\\mathbb Q$ such that the representation is trivial after a Tate twist over $K$. Then the Galois invariant subspace is the whole space. Alternately, because you began with an assumption about Hodge numbers, you can use the Hodge conjecture. $\\endgroup$ Will Sawin –  Will Sawin 2020-08-05 15:28:38 +00:00 Commented Aug 5, 2020 at 15:28 1 $\\begingroup$ I don't think so - How could it be? $\\endgroup$ Will Sawin –  Will Sawin 2020-08-05 16:15:43 +00:00 Commented Aug 5, 2020 at 16:15 2 $\\begingroup$ You don't need the Hodge or Tate conjecture, only Deligne's conjecture that all Hodge classes are absolutely Hodge. $\\endgroup$ anon –  anon 2020-08-06 17:25:45 +00:00 Commented Aug 6, 2020 at 17:25  |  Show 3 more comments 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
