  "body": "$\\DeclareMathOperator\\PSL{PSL}$ Let the type of the character theory of a finite group $G$ be the list $[[d_1,n_1], \\dotsc, [d_k,n_k]]$ with $1=d_1 < \\dotsb < d_k$ and $n_i$ the number of irreducible characters of degree $d_i$ . There is a global understanding of the character theory of the finite groups $\\PSL(2,q)$ with $q$ a prime power, if $q \\equiv 0 \\pmod2$ , it is of type $[[1,1],[q-1,\\frac{q}{2}],[q,1],[q+1,\\frac{q-2}{2}]]$ , if $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod4$ , it is of type $[[1,1],[\\frac{q+1}{2},2],[q-1,\\frac{q-1}{4}],[q,1],[q+1,\\frac{q-5}{4}]]$ , if $q \\equiv 3 \\pmod4$ , it is of type $[[1,1],[\\frac{q-1}{2},2],[q-1,\\frac{q-3}{4}],[q,1],[q+1,\\frac{q-3}{4}]]$ , and according to these three cases, there is a global way to write the character table of $\\PSL(2,q)$ . It was first computed by H. Jordan ( Group-Characters of Various Types of Linear Groups , 1907). The table is directly available in Character table of $\\PSL(2, \\mathbb F_q)$ of J. Adams (see also his detailed note Character tables for $\\operatorname{GL}(2)$ , $\\operatorname{SL}(2)$ , $\\operatorname{PGL}(2)$ , and $\\PSL(2)$ over a finite field for the proof). The character table of a finite group $G$ and the Schur orthogonality relations provide the Grothendieck ring (where $n_{i,j}^k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ ): $$ \\chi_i \\chi_j = \\sum_k n_{i,j}^k \\chi_k. $$ Let $U_i$ be an irreducible unitary representation related to the character $\\chi_i$ . Then there are $G$ -isomorphisms $\\Phi_{i,j}$ : $$ \\Phi_{i,j} : U_i \\otimes U_j \\to \\bigoplus_k M_{i,j}^k \\otimes U_k $$ with $M_{i,j}^k$ a multiplicity space of dimension $n_{i,j}^k$ . Question : What are explicit maps $\\Phi_{i,j}$ for $G = \\PSL(2,q)$ , with a global understanding (as for the character table)? gr.group-theory rt.representation-theory lie-groups finite-groups unitary-representations Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jul 28, 2020 at 18:52 LSpice 14k 4 4 gold badges 48 48 silver badges 76 76 bronze badges asked Jul 28, 2020 at 17:48 Sebastien Palcoux 27.6k 5 5 gold badges 83 83 silver badges 204 204 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 1 1 $\\begingroup$ There are two typos in the second table that Jeffrey Adams put here (I just pointed out to him): first line: (q-7)/4 should be (q-3)/4; last column, middle line: 1 should be -1. $\\endgroup$ Sebastien Palcoux –  Sebastien Palcoux 2020-07-28 17:55:11 +00:00 Commented Jul 28, 2020 at 17:55 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
