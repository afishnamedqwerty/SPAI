It is known that its cohomology ring is $$H_k=\\Q[c_1,\\ldots, c_k, \\bar c_1,\\ldots,\\bar c_{N-k}]$$ modulo the ideal generated by homogeneous parts of $$(1+c_1t+c_2t^2+\\ldots)(1+\\bar c_1t + \\bar c_2 t^2+\\ldots +\\bar c_{N-k}t^{N-k})-1.$$ Denote this description by (A) . On the other hand, we can consider the quotient $$H_k=\\frac{\\Q[e_1, \\ldots, e_k]}{(h_i|i > N-k)},$$ where $e_i$ denotes the $i$ -th elementary symmetric polynomial in $k$ -variables, and $h_i$ denotes the $i$ -th complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial, i.e. $$\\Q[e_1,\\ldots, e_k]=\\Q[x_1,\\ldots, x_k]^{S_k}.$$ Call this description (B) . Developing the $h$ in terms of $e$ shows that indeed both descriptions of $H_k$ coincide, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2128 , §5, and the referenced equations. Passage to partial flag varieties Now let us instead consider $\\Gr(k, l, N)$ , the variety of subspaces $$\\{V_k\\subseteq V_l\\subseteq V_N|\\dim V_i=i\\}.$$ It is known that its cohomology ring $H_{k,l}$ is $$\\Q[c_{11}, \\ldots, c_{1k}, c_{2,1},\\ldots, c_{2,l-k}, c_{3,1},\\ldots, c_{3,N-l}]$$ modulo the ideal generated by homogeneous parts of $$(1+c_{11}t+\\ldots+c_{1k}t^k)(1+c_{2,1}t+\\ldots+c_{2,l-k}t^{l-k})(1+c_{3,1}+\\ldots+c_{3,N-l}t^{N-l})-1.$$ It admits inclusions from $H_k$ and $H_l$ , coming from the map that forgets one subspace. This can be generalized for any sequence of increasing dimensions. My Question In the case where we consider the Grassmannian for one subspace, we could find the alternative description (B) in terms of symmetric polynomials. Is there a description (B) for $H_{k,l,\\ldots}$ ? quantum-groups symmetric-functions grassmannians flag-varieties categorification Share Cite Improve this question Follow edited Jun 15, 2020 at 7:27 Community Bot 1 2 2 silver badges 3 3 bronze badges asked Jul 4, 2017 at 15:18 Bubaya 387 1 1 silver badge 7 7 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
