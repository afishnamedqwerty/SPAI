  "body": "Let $A\\rightarrow R$ be a local homomorphism of Noetherian strict henselian local rings with completions $\\hat{A},\\hat{R}$ . Let $u\\in R^\\times, x\\in R$ be such that there is a unique $\\hat{A}$ -linear automorphism of $\\hat{R}$ sending $x\\mapsto ux$ . Must there exist an $A$ -linear automorphism of $R$ sending $x\\mapsto ux$ ? Context: I want to say that if $A[x]\\rightarrow R$ is the strict henselization of $A[x]$ at $x = 0$ , and $g\\in\\text{Aut}_A(R)$ has order $n$ invertible in $A$ , then there is an automorphism (\"reparametrization\") $\\alpha\\in\\text{Aut}_A(R)$ such that $g(\\alpha(x)) = \\zeta_n\\alpha(x)$ for some primitive $n$ th root of unity. I can show the existence of this $\\alpha$ only in the completion $\\hat{R}$ , where it is given by $x\\mapsto ux$ for some $u\\in R^\\times$ . More precisely, I can find such a $u\\in R^\\times$ such that $g(ux) = \\zeta_n ux$ , and the explicit form of the completion shows that this defines an automorphism, but I don't know if it comes from an automorphism of $R$ . ag.algebraic-geometry ac.commutative-algebra Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Jul 17, 2020 at 4:11 stupid_question_bot 7,795 1 1 gold badge 13 13 silver badges 53 53 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
