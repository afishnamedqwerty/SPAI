  "body": "Let $\\mathbb{S}_m$ be the symmetric group on $m$ letters. Let $n=m-1$ . Let $\\mathbf{w}=a_1\\cdots a_r$ be a word on the alphabet $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ . We say that $\\mathbf{w}$ gives rise to an enumeration of elements of the symmetric group $\\mathbb{S}_m$ if $1,s_{a_r},s_{a_{r-1}}s_{a_r},\\ldots,s_{a_2}\\cdots s_{a_r},s_{a_1}\\cdots s_{a_r}$ are all distinct elements of the symmetric group $\\mathbb{S}_m$ . For example, $32323132323132323$ gives rise to an enumeration of elements of the symmetric group $\\mathbb{S}_4$ , and I think it is (one of) the longest possible such words. Q. What is the length $r(n)$ of the longest word which gives rise to an enumeration of elements of the symmetric group $\\mathbb{S}_m$ . Is it always possible to find such a word of length $m!$ , or only for $\\mathbb{S}_3$ ? co.combinatorics permutations symmetric-groups coxeter-groups combinatorics-on-words Share Cite Improve this question Follow asked Aug 11, 2020 at 7:27 Christoph Mark 1,106 1 1 gold badge 8 8 silver badges 18 18 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 6 6 $\\begingroup$ You are trying to list all $m!$ permutations in $\\mathbb{S}_m$ in such a way that each permutation in the list is obtained from the previous one by interchanging two adjacent entries. This is done in Knuth's TAoCP , volume 4A, Section 7.2.1.2, under the subheading \"Adjacent interchanges\". (This is one of the things classically referred to as \"change ringing\".) $\\endgroup$ darij grinberg –  darij grinberg 2020-08-11 09:13:54 +00:00 Commented Aug 11, 2020 at 9:13 1 $\\begingroup$ An old version of Section 7.2.1.2 is available at www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc2b.ps.gz . $\\endgroup$ darij grinberg –  darij grinberg 2020-08-11 09:15:48 +00:00 Commented Aug 11, 2020 at 9:15 4 $\\begingroup$ Based on your questions list, you might like Conway's \"Gray Codes for Reflection Groups\" which generalizes this to all finite reflection groups. $\\endgroup$ Hugh Denoncourt –  Hugh Denoncourt 2020-08-11 13:12:55 +00:00 Commented Aug 11, 2020 at 13:12 1 $\\begingroup$ Is $s_a$ the transposition $(a, a + 1)$? $\\endgroup$ LSpice –  LSpice 2020-08-11 14:18:22 +00:00 Commented Aug 11, 2020 at 14:18 1 $\\begingroup$ @LSpice Yes, it is the simple transposition. $\\endgroup$ Christoph Mark –  Christoph Mark 2020-08-12 05:15:22 +00:00 Commented Aug 12, 2020 at 5:15  |  Show 1 more comment 0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
