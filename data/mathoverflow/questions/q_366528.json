  "title": "derived categories - Compute Cech cohomology with two open sets",
  "body": "Let $(X,\\mathcal{O}_X)$ be a topological ringed space and $(U,V)$ be an open covering of $X$ (i.e. $U$ and $V$ are two open subsets of $X$ such that $U\\cup V=X$ ). Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf of $\\mathcal{O}_X$ -module. The following statement seems very natural to me although I never found it written: There is a quasi-isomorphism, natural in $\\mathcal{F}$ , $R\\Gamma(X,\\mathcal{F})\\stackrel{\\sim}{\\to} \\operatorname{cone}[-1](R\\Gamma(U,\\mathcal{F})\\oplus R\\Gamma(V,\\mathcal{F})\\stackrel{(1,-1)}{\\longrightarrow}R\\Gamma(U\\cap V,\\mathcal{F}))$ in the derived category of $\\mathcal{O}_X(X)$ -modules. Does anyone got some hints or references?
