Because $M$ is obtained from $B$ by censoring the first block of states, in the language of Markov chains, i.e., $I-M$ is a Schur complement of $I-B$; in particular, if $B$ is stochastic then $M$ is, too, and the Perron eigenvector of $M$ is given by chopping off the last first block of that of $B$. $\\endgroup$ Federico Poloni –  Federico Poloni 2018-11-20 07:49:39 +00:00 Commented Nov 20, 2018 at 7:49 $\\begingroup$ In fact, the maximum eigenvalue of $B$ is positive and greater than 1. Also $M$ is coming from the following multiplication:$B_3B_2B_1 in which $\\\\ $ B_1=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c|c|c} 0 &B_{12}&B_{13}\\\\ \\hline 0& I& 0\\\\ \\hline 0& 0&I \\end{array} \\right]$ \\ $ B_2=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c|c|c} I &0&0\\\\ \\hline B_{21}& 0& B_{23}\\\\ \\hline 0& 0&I \\end{array} \\right]$ \\ $ B_3=\\left[ \\begin{array}{c|c|c} I &0&0\\\\ \\hline 0& I& 0\\\\ \\hline B_{31}& B_{32}&0 \\end{array} \\right]$ $\\endgroup$ afra –  afra 2018-11-20 13:04:36 +00:00 Commented Nov 20, 2018 at 13:04 $\\begingroup$ What motivated this question? $\\endgroup$ Rodrigo de Azevedo –  Rodrigo de Azevedo 2020-07-17 19:30:12 +00:00 Commented Jul 17, 2020 at 19:30 Add a comment  |  0 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) You must log in to answer this question.
